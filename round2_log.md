### Day 1: January 10th, 2022
Dusted off my GitHub account, sorted this repo a bit and started with round 2 files. Made a plan and I am ready to start - it's you and me, unfinished business from 2020 :) 

Completed ES6 chapter from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with JS promises. Next stop - Regular Expressions. 

While preparing this, had a good refresher of Markdown syntax and bit of a "starting a new challeng" rush. Felt quite nice. Ofcourse, it took me more time to write a Twitter post than entry to this journal, so..jeah, same old same old.git

### Day 2: January 11th, 2022
Started regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of patteren making, character sets and flags. Regular expressions were always hard to read for me, so I decided to spend more time on this topic and have another go at it tomorrow. 

Not a bad session overall.

### Day 3: January 12th, 2022
Completed regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of grouping and combining patterns with "or" operators. Kind of rushed it as I only had little time between putting my kid to sleep and rushing to the semi night shift maintenance windows at work.

Need to try to manage time better.
