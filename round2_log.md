### Day 1: January 10th, 2022
Dusted off my GitHub account, sorted this repo a bit and started with round 2 files. Made a plan and I am ready to start - it's you and me, unfinished business from 2020 :) 

Completed ES6 chapter from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with JS promises. Next stop - Regular Expressions. 

While preparing this, had a good refresher of Markdown syntax and bit of a "starting a new challeng" rush. Felt quite nice. Ofcourse, it took me more time to write a Twitter post than entry to this journal, so..jeah, same old same old.git 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1480659476017553410)

### Day 2: January 11th, 2022
Started regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of patteren making, character sets and flags. Regular expressions were always hard to read for me, so I decided to spend more time on this topic and have another go at it tomorrow. 

Not a bad session overall.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1481031039090937860)

### Day 3: January 12th, 2022
Completed regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of grouping and combining patterns with "or" operators. Kind of rushed it as I only had little time between putting my kid to sleep and rushing to the semi night shift maintenance windows at work.

Need to try to manage time better.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1481379638760857605)

### Day 4: January 13th, 2022
Completed the debugging chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of debugging in the browser console, checking the code for spelling/syntax errors and escaping infinite loops.

Did not learn anything new but had a brief refresher + one more chapter of the course completed.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1481737603128999938)

### Day 5: January 15th, 2022
Skipped a day yesterday so pushed almost two hours today to compensate. Completed the Basic Data Structures chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of arrays, objects and associated methods.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1482471615946502148)

### Day 6: January 16th, 2022
Started and went through about a third of Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). This chapter had some real challanges so it was fun. Worked with arrays and writing logic for reshaping, sorting and filtering.

This one will will return the lenght if the longest word in a sentence and it's all mine :) 

```
function findLongestWordLenght(str) {
  let arr = str.split(" ");
  let max = 0;

  for(let i = 0; i <= arr.length-1; i++) {
    let len = arr[i].length;
    
    if(max < len) {
      max = len;
    }
  }

  return max;
}
```

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1482854591498752004)

### Day 7: January 17th, 2022
Went through another third of Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and had a really good time with simple string and array algorithms for changing words and filtering sentences.

Also a good refresher on some strign and array methods which I forgot. I forgot a lot.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1483192458355916806)

### Day 8: January 18th, 2022
Completed Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and had more fun with array filtering and mutating simple algorithms.

I was poorely motivated and had a hard time keeping focus so it took more time than necessary + I had to google alot again. Need to work on my sleep quality and stress management.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1483577901706530829)

### Day 9: January 19th, 2022
Went through most of the Object Oriented Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with object, constructors, and prototype chain. Kept it a bit shorter than usual as it's my birthday.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1483937160436793350)

### Day 10: January 20th, 2022
Completed Object Oriented Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked more with objects and inheritance. Not a particulary productive day as I was poorely motivated and lacking iterest in the topic but pushed through it. Solid refresher at the end.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1484266459639525376)

### Day 11: January 22th, 2022
Skipped a day as yesterday I did to little to count it as a day, so pushed a bit harder today to compensate. Completed Functional Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I mostly worked with array methods and had a few suprising challenges. Great chapter overall.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1484923510287912964)

### Day 12: January 23rd, 2022
Started Intermediate Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through about one fourth of the challenges. Mostly worked with arrays and objects and had to google a bit about regex and object methods. 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1485300427402928137)

### Day 13: January 24rd, 2022
Completed almonst 50% of Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with strings, arrays and more tricky games with rearranging words and letters - had a great time and spent a lot of time.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1485730404715962368)

### Day 14: January 26th, 2022
Skipped another day due to being exausted and not having time to do much. Pushed bit more today and completed Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) I did have to Google alot especially for the math challenges but ultimately produced results. This was a very good insight into how much I still don't know and need to learn.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1486443885874368526)

### Day 15: January 27th, 2022
Started final projects in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I solved two - paliendrome checker & ruman numerals conventer. I spent almost two hours on the roman numerals and after a solid session of while loops and If statemens, I checked Google a bit and saw a simpler implementation of my own logic. Bit of a cheat, but I did understand it.

```
function convertToRoman(numb) {
  const mappings = {
    M:  1000,
    CM: 900,
    D:  500,
    CD: 400,
    C:  100,
    XC: 90,
    L:  50,
    XL: 40,
    X:  10,
    IX: 9,
    V:  5,
    IV: 4,
    I:  1,
  };  

  let result = '';
  
  for (let key in mappings) {
    while(num <= 0) {
      result+= key;
      num -= mappings[key];
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1486840405647929345)

### Day 16: January 28th, 2022
Continued with final projects in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Today I took it easy and solved one project, the "Caesars Cipher" with the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) substitution cipher which I solved completely by myself, without even looking at JS documentation, using most basic of functions - for loops and if statemes. It was a blast.

```
function rot13(str) {
  const alphabet="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".split("");
  const string = str.slice().toUpperCase().split("");
  let decodedString =[];

  for(let i = 0; i <= string.length-1; i++) {
    let index = alphabet.indexOf(string[i]);
    
    if(index == -1) {
      decodedString.push(string[i]);
    } else if(index < 13) {
        decodedString.push(alphabet[index+13]);
    } else {
        decodedString.push(alphabet[index-13]);
    }
  }
return decodedString.join("");

}
```

### Day 17: January 29th, 2022
Continued with final projects in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I completed one focusing on the regex usage and it was great as it forced me to look up regex documentation once again. Finally, I can say I'm feeling a bit more confortable with regexes in general and understand them better. Last project from the course I also started but leaving it for tomorrow.

Validation of the US telephone numbers I wrote:

```
function telephoneCheck(str) {
  const usPhonePattern = /^(?:\d{3}|\(\d{3}\)|1\s?\d{3}|1\s?\(\d{3}\))(?:\-|\s)?\d{3}(?:\-|\s)?\d{4}$/;

  return usPhonePattern.test(str);
 
}
```
[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1487528736102756356)

### Day 18: January 29th, 2022
Completed the "Cash register" final project in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) after more than 2 hours of covering all cases. Take that, unifinished business from 2020!

Gonna use next session to find good Python material to start learning basic sytnax and scripting there before I move to the databases.

Cash register solution

```
function checkCashRegister(price, cash, cid) {
  /* Money units in cents to escape math with decimals */
  let currency = {
    "ONE HUNDRED": 10000,
    "TWENTY": 2000,
    "TEN": 1000,
    "FIVE": 500,
    "ONE": 100,
    "QUARTER": 25,
    "DIME": 10,
    "NICKEL": 5,
    "PENNY": 1
  }

  /* How much the change is */
  let change = (cash * 100) - (price *100);

  /* How much money is in the drawer */
  let cidSum = 0;

  for (let elem of cid) {
    cidSum += elem[1] * 100;
  }

  /* Main logic cases */

  if(change > cidSum) {
    /* IF more to return that in drawer, return insufficiend funds */
    return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []};

  } else if (change == cidSum) {
      /* If we have exact money to return, return closed with change as cid */
      return {status: "CLOSED", change: cid};

  } else {
    /* Other cases where we have enough money to return change and need to update the drawer content */
    cid = cid.reverse();
    let returnedChange = [];

    /* Looping through the change drawer*/
    for (let elem of cid) {
      elem[1] = elem[1]*100

      /* Looping the currency to match appropriate money units we are taking from the drawer to return change and if there are any */
      let returnedCurrency = [elem[0], 0];
      while (change >= currency[elem[0]] && elem[1] > 1) {

        /* Decrement change and current drawer money unit as you return money */
        change -= currency[elem[0]];
        elem[1] -= currency[elem[0]];

        /* Add returned money units to the array returned to original currency (divided by 100) */
        returnedCurrency[1] += currency[elem[0]]/100;
      } 
      /* Push to the totals array */
      returnedChange.push(returnedCurrency);
      };

    if (change > 0) {
      return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []};
    }

    return {status: "OPEN", change: returnedChange.filter(current => current[1] !== 0)};
  }
}
```

### Day 19: January 31th, 2022
Used today's session to review my goals and check online content for learning Python as I decided I will do that next while I'm still "warm" from the JavaScript Course. Plan is to learn basic Python syntax and use cases and test it as a tool for automating everyday computer tasks at work before I continue to databases and preparations for the DevOps tools.

I decided to go with the [Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp) and parallel to that I will do the FreeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) if I manage to squize it. Important thing to remember here is that I do not want to stuck on this topic - just learn enough to be able to test the language and to be able to easy dig in later if I need it. And from what I see in the trends, I'll need it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1488276940905926658)

### Day 20: February 1st, 2022
Started [Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp), went through introductory explanations, installed Anaconda3 suite but also prepared VS Code for Python as that is what I'll rather use. All set to learn, I started with the basic data structures and already wrote dozen of unnecessary semicolons.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1488632443250913281)

### Day 21: February 2nd, 2022
Continued with basic data structures in Python, did strings and lists today and explored some of their methods. Interesting, `list.sort()` just sorts the list, not returning it sorted - meaning, you can't do `new_list = list.sort()`, first you sort it, then do the `new_list = list` for example. Interesting language.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1488993041671237640)

### Day 22: February 3rd, 2022
Continued with basic data structures and associated methonds in Python. Today was a bit slower seesion as I was tired and already squized but managed to go thruugh dictionaries, tuples, sets, booleans and basic IO which I'll need to revise tomorrow. Not that much of a productive session but I kept on for an hour.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1489359950866440195)

### Day 23: February 4th, 2022
Completed basic data structures and objects in Python which was first module of the course I'm taking. There was a solid school like test at the end - not a big fan of the method but nailed it ;) I do hope future assessments will be project based.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1489714603647029255)


### Day 24: February 6th, 2022
Skipped a day as yesterday I felt it was not enough to call it a day. Then today had even less time to do anything, so two half days, let's say it was a day. And a lousy one. Seems weekends are hardest to do anything these days. So, control flow - if, elif, else, for loops and while loops. Digging the syntax for this gotta say.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1490456078693416960)

### Day 25: February 7th, 2022
Completed second module of the Python course where I worked with control flow logic and iteration.  Today I reviewed useful functions for working with lists and for loops (such as `enumerate()`) and list comprehension way of writing for loops which basicly flattens the for loop. Gotta say it's weird and not that intuitive at first.

```
# Example

my_list = [current for current in "Hello"]

# is same as

my_list = []
for current in "Hello":
  my_list.append(current)

# Output: ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
```

### Day 26: February 8th, 2022
Little detour today as I had an opportunity to solve a problem at work by using Python so I took a swing at it.
Idea is to have a simple downloader script which authenticates to Google Cloud service and pulls files from the storage bucket. Luckly, there are pretty convenient libraries for that. 

Little less luckly, I had to reinstall my Python setup, troubleshoot missing PIP modules which were actually installed and write code blind as I did not have service keys and needed info to test my script. On the bright side - it was fun, I tried Try and Except statements and actually reinforced some concepts learned in the previous lesson.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1491176557289021449)

### Day 27: February 9th, 2022
Worked a bit more on my Google Storage downloader script then continued with the course where I started learning functions and methods. Basics today, wrote a simple calculator function. Really liking the syntax.

### Day 28: February 11th, 2022
Skipped a day again, this time I was too tired and just was not able to follow anything. Today did a bit better but under same conditions. Continued with functions, did few examples with tuples and tuples unpacking. Tried appening to lists using Javascript methonds ofcourse :D 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1492250996503949315)


### Day 29: February 12th, 2022
Today I did good - managed to spend almost three hours on function excercizes solving simple problems in Python. Tomorrow round 2 :)
```
# ALMOST THERE 
  # Given an integer n, return True if n is within 10 of either 100 or 200

  # almost_there(90) --> True
  # almost_there(104) --> True
  # almost_there(150) --> False
  # almost_there(209) --> True

def almost_there(n):
  n = abs(n)
  r1 = range(90,111)
  r2 = range (190,211)

  if n in r1 or n in r2:
    return True
  else:
    pass
  
  return False
```

### Day 30: February 13th, 2022
Another good day, little less productive but still good. Round two of solving simple challenges in Python where aim was to get confortable with functions. Spent almost an hour on one which lists prime numbers from an range. Actually I am kind of proud as I had good logic but got stuck on second loop printing all odd numbers instead of primes. Then I saw few examples and figured I need a flag to make sure only prime number gets appended in the first loop. Good times :) 

```
def count_primes(num):
  primes = [] # Initialize empty list
  for n in range(2,num+1): # Looping from 2 (first prime number) to our feeded number
    is_prime = True # Status flag to flag if number is prime
    for i in range(2,n): # Another loop from 2 to current number from the first loop
      if (n % i) == 0: 
         is_prime = False # In case number is divisible, status flag is false
      else:
        pass
    if is_prime == True: # Back to the first loop - if flag is true, append number to list since it's prime number
      primes.append(n)
    else:
      pass

  print(primes)
  return len(primes)

```

### Day 31: February 14th, 2022
Today I was a bit less productive but took the chance to check on web solutions for challenges I was solving last two days to see how syntax and logic can improve. While doing it, I figured how to make my initial function for checking primes without any flags from yesterday work - FOR ELSE statement. Started a bit with map() and filter() methods but will leave it for tomorrow.

```
# My original logic without the flag, it was not working because I was unaware of the posibility to have an For - Else statement
def count_primes_2(num):
  primes = []
  for n in range(2,num+1):
    for i in range(2,n):
      if n % i == 0:
        break
    else:
      primes.append(n)

  print(primes)
  return len(primes)
```

### Day 32: February 16th, 2022
Skipped another day as yesterday, even though I did learn for more than an hour, I did not feel like I finished the topic so it made more sense to finish it today. So, yesterday and today I worked with lambda expressions, `map()` and `filter()` methods and read about scope in Python where I tested on few examples the LEGB lookup order of checking the variable assigment.

**LEGB Rule**

Order of resolving variable names in Python.
* L - local, names assigned within a def or lambda function and not declared global in that function
* E - enclosing function locals, names in the local scope of any function, from inner to outer
* G - global, names assigned at the top lovel of a module file or declared global in a def within the file
* B - built-in Python, names preassigned in the built-in names module

### Day 33: February 17th, 2022
Another round of practicing functions with challenges in Python, good session.

```
# Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not. (Assume the string passed in does not have any punctuation)
  # Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
  # For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

import string

def ispangram(str1, alphabet=string.ascii_lowercase):
  prep = set(str1.replace(" ","").lower())
  alph = set(alphabet)
 
  return prep.issuperset(alph)

```

### Day 34: February 19th, 2022
Skipped a day as yesterday I needed a day off. Today started with the first bigger project, Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. Lets see :) 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1495150907864014849)


### Day 35: February 20th, 2022
Ok, more than 3 hours of coding today, pretty good. Started my Tic-tac-toe project and wanted to try working with dictionaries and function separation so ended up complicating things more than needed, as usual. But, feels it will be a good experience producing problems like this and solving them.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1495531158234443784)


### Day 36: February 21th, 2022
Continued with my Tic-tac-toe game where I expanded functionalities a bit, added more user info, rounds and basic stats tracking. Basicly, producing problems as I go. Big fun, tomorrow I plan to finish it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1495882494553567240)


### Day 37: February 22th, 2022
Completed my Tic-tac-toe game and had a blast. Added rounds and moves counter, fixed tie logic, handled game over and print stats functions Refactored a bit and decided it is time to move on else I might keep adding things to this for who knows how long :D 

While doing it, learned a lot, expecially about scope in Python. Looking forward to the Object oriented approach.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1496240588970246158)


### Day 38: February 23th, 2022
Today I took it easy and started by exploring few other Tic-tac-toe solutions just to see how other were approaching it which was useful and interesting to se how same problems can be solved with similar/same logic but differently written.

After that I started with the new course module which will explore object oriented programming and learned about basic class creation, constructor function and creating methods.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1496612299246907397)


### Day 39: February 24th, 2022
Continued with object oriented programming in Python where I worked with basics: creating classes, defining constructors, attributes, object attributes and methods.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1496962657177460740)


### Day 40: February 26th, 2022
Yesterday I skiped a day as there was literally no time for this and today had to do a little detour to solve a thing on the job - SQL crashcourse. Learn basics of database queries and solved a problem.  

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1497680581978730503)


### Day 41: February 27th, 2022
Continued with OOP in Python where I learned about inheritance, polymorphism and some of the useful magic methods for giving logic to class instances when print or len are being called on them. After that I did few excercises, mostly geometry based, which was a strange but satisfying experience. I was implementing logic for calculating cylinder surface area and distance and slope based on given coordinates. It's been a looong time :) 

```
import math

class Line:
    
    def __init__(self,coor1,coor2):
        self.x1, self.y1 = coor1
        self.x2, self.y2 = coor2
    
    def distance(self):
        return math.sqrt(((self.x2 - self.x1) ** 2) + ((self.y2 - self.y1) ** 2))
    
    def slope(self):
        return (self.y2 - self.y1) / (self.x2 - self.x1)
```

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1498049317961179149)


### Day 42: February 28th, 2022
Did another challenge exercise today where I created a bank account class having some basic user info, transaction counters and methods for withdrawing and depositing money. It was fun. After that, started reading about PyPI repository and using pip command line tool for administering packages.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1498423826971045890)


### Day 43: March 2nd, 2022
Skipped another day as yesterday I did the modules and packaging in Pythong but did not had time to test it properly. Today I wrote a small package containg sub package to see how the import will go. Then went through error handling where I learned the basics of the try - except - else - finally chain.

```
def ask_for_int():
  while True:
    try:
      result = int(input("Please provide a number: "))
    except:
      # In case of error:
      print("Whoops, not a number!")
      continue # Loop continues (keyword continue is not explicitly needed)
    else:
      # In case there is not error:
      print("Thank you, that is a number.")
      break # Loop breaks as the number is provided
    finally:
      # This runs anyways
      print("End of the try/except/else/finally block")
```

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1499142424752541699)


### Day 44: March 3rd, 2022
Today I was learning about unit testing and linting in Pythong where I learned basics of Pyling and unittest libraries. After that, started with few challenges to practice oop in Python. Will do a card game called War for starters.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1499494632077602821)


### Day 45: March 5th, 2022
Another day skipped, I was so tired I felt almost sick so decided to rather rest. Today was better so continued with my War card game project in Python where I wrote needed classes. Up next is the main game logic, will try to complete it all tomorrow.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1500250068372307968)


### Day 46: March 6th, 2022
Almost done with the War card game project - coded main logic and the war situation - only thing left to do is cover the case where user has less cards than needed to participate in war.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1500596266484617221)


### Day 47: March 7th, 2022
Completed the War card game project in Python. Added new class for game status and refractored the code to implement it. Fixed "war situation" issues and concluded that most of the bugs were actualy either because of typos, or because of pasting blocks of code an not changing the variables in it. Valuable lesson.

Started heavy with the next project - Blackjack game. Needed to learn how to play it first.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1500947493391147009)


### Day 48: March 8th, 2022
Continued with my Blackjack card game project in Python. Wrote all classes an started with the main logic while adjusting methods along the way. Two loops for now - one for turn and one for repeating the prompt. Plan to add outer loop for round to provide "Play again" functionality, will se if I can pull it of by adjusting two current loops to just one and integrade prompts into turn.

Probaly overcomplicated it again but will finish it on my own, then check other solutions to see what I can improve logic wise.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1501318629752717321)


### Day 49: March 9th, 2022
Completed the Blackjack card game project in Python but I do see some repeating of same lines throught the main logic so I am leaving space for some refactoring tomorrow before I call it finished. Worked mostly on the main logic, added outer loop for the round count and fixed turn loop to accomodate exchange of both human and machine players. Good session.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1501684386366103555)


### Day 50: March 10th, 2022
A bit shorter session today. Refactored the Blackjack project a bit by making few methods out of repeating code and recostructing some dictionaries to have lists as values which reduced number of globals in general so good practice I would say. Then checked the course solution and some other on the web and got a bit discouraged as it seems my solution was bit longer and maybe less "smarter" but on the other hand it is completely mine so that must be a good thing. It's always interesting to see other approaches. Conclusion is that I am definetely prone to complicating things :D

### Day 51: March 12th, 2022
Took a day off yesterday and used the time today to reflect on my challenge progress so far, since I just went over half of the challenge I thought it is a good spot to see how I'm doing in relation to the initial plan. So, in 50 days I've completed the FreeCodeCamp's JS certification (unfinished business from 2020.) and learned basics of Python programming with some smaller things also completed such as getting confortable with regexes. 

Now, my plan was highly optimistic from the getgo and generaly packed with many different topics where I actually wanted to revise already known topics and explore them in more detail with the goal of preparing myself for learning devops tools and routines in round 3 of the challenge. But as Python was very interesting I decided to give it at least 10 to 15 more days to explore it better before I move on, after which I will probably do the databases in more detail which will be the bridge towards Linux and Windows system administration and scripting available in native languages there. 

Although I am satisfied with what I was able to learn in 50 days I do notice a lack of discipline and motivation sometimes which is why I have more skipped days. So, need to adress those things also in the second half of the challenge.

Now, as for the day 51, revised scope in Python a bit and started reading about decorators.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1502767863723175939)


### Day 52: March 14th, 2022
Hit it hard today as yesterday I felt it was not enough to count it as a day. Funny how sometimes you dont want to spend your challenge day if it was not conrete or productive enough. So, decorators and generators today, with more focus on generators as those seems far likely I will use. Checked Flask a bit to see how decorators are used in "real life" as that framework seems to use them heavily. 

Since I really had time today (which is so rare these days), also started the FreeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing With Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) course and went over 15% of it. It makes sense to take another certificate while learning Python and solidify the basics which are actually explained very well there.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1503349771435708422)


### Day 53: March 15th, 2022
Today was hard af as my concentration, motivation and overall mood was so low I had to really push myself. But I did started new module of the course where topic is exploring different Python modules so many shorter lessons which was good for the day. Managed to go through collections, os and shutil.

Also did few more topics from the FreeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing With Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) course and brought myself to 20 % of the course. Not bad for such a lousy day.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1503844455882932225)


### Day 54: March 17th, 2022
Another skipped day as yesterday there was simply no time for proper session and later at night I was just too tired. Today continued exploring Python modules, worked with datetime module where I learned how to work with date and time.

Also did few more topics from the FreeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing With Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) course and brought myself to almost 30 % of the course. Had to really push it today as besides being tired I was extremely poorely motivated.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1504574896273125405)


### Day 55: March 18th, 2022
Continued explorin Python modules - today I went over math module and random module. Pretty useful both of them although math I will probably not use in any serious extent.

Went over few topics form FCC's course. Bit of a shorter session, will try to compensate tomorrow.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1504926352935469064)


### Day 56: March 19th, 2022
More of Python modules - today explored pdb Python debuger which seems useful. It's cool how it's set_trace() method pauses the script and gives you sort of CLI option to check the code.

Then worked with re library and regular expressions in Python.

```
## Character Identifiers
  # \d - a digit
  # \w - both letter and digit
  # \s - white space
  # \D - non digit
  # \W - other than numbers and letters
  # \S - other than whitespace

## Quantifiers
  # These are placed after character identifiers to indicate what occurs how many times
  # +     - Occurs one or more times
  # {3}   - Occurs exactlx 3 times
  # {2,4} - Occurs 2 to 4 times
  # {3,}  - Occurs 3 times or more
  # *     - Occurs zero or more times
  # ?     - Occurs once or none

## Other useful syntax
  # | - or operator (r"cat|dog" will match cat or dog in a sentence)
  # . - wildcard operator (r".at" will match cat, hat or anything in front of "at")
  # ... - three wildcard operators (means one dot only catches one character, for more we need more)
  # ^ - caret symbol, means "starts with" (r"^\d" catches "1" in "1 is a number")
  # $ - means "ends with" (r"$\d" catches "1" in "There is a number 1")
  # [^something] - exclusion or inclusion groups 
    # r"[^\d]+" catches "abc" in "a1 b2 c2" and returns it as list
      # Usefull for removing things, such as removing punctuation from a sentence for example.
  # () - grouping
      # r"cat(fish|nap|claw)" will catch catfish, catnap and catclow but will not catch caterpillar.
      # if used with re.compile() it can return separate groups by index nums starting with 1

```

### Day 57: March 20th, 2022
Another day for exploring Python modules - today I worked with time and timeit modules where I was mesuring how much time it took for a function to execute so I could benchmark few different approaches and see which one performes better. Very usefull in timeit where you actually repeat same block many times so you get a finer bechmark.

Also worked with zipfile module and adding to/extracting from zip archives in Python and after went through one lesson from the FreeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing With Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) where I'm now on 30%.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1505663797960364034)


### Day 58: March 21th, 2022
Today had a fun kind of a data digging challenge to test skills I got from exploring the modules where I had to download a zip file from the github repo, extract it to get instructions of the challenge and it was a whole bunch of folders with text files where I needed to search each one for a unknown phone number and return it. 

It was a blast + I learned how to dowload files from urls with Python. After that solved few topics from the Scientific Computing With Python course on the FreeCodeCamp.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1506034714234212352)


### Day 59: March 22th, 2022
Today I had very little time and since I'll be traveling tomorrow and the day after, there will be no that much time in those days either. So plan is to use the lack of time to do the FreeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing With Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/).

So today's work was all about the data structures in that course where I got to around 45%. Plan is to have tomorrow and the day after tomorrow counted as a one day where I'll go over 50% of the course.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1506383169154605057)


### Day 60: March 25th, 2022
While it sounds like a plausable thing to do, learning while on business trip with very tight all day schedule is really not. So had a two day break from this is best way to describe it as the things I was able to do were not really something to be seriously counted.

So today pushed [Scientific Computing With Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) to achieve what I was planning and got to around 55% of the course. Next stop internet protocols and web scraping.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1507461465170620419)


### Day 61: March 26th, 2022
Started learning about web scraping with Python where I went throught basics of request and beatutifulSoup libraries and how to get pages and target specific elements using CSS selectors. It was a nice refresher on the CSS too.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1507844472108900363)


### Day 62: March 27th, 2022
Continued with web page scraping in Python where I was practicing on the [tosrape](https://toscrape.com/) page with fake books library. Challenge I completed was to scrape the title of all books rated with two stars, code below. Will do one more day on this topic as it is highly interesting.


```
import requests
import bs4

def get_stuff(url):
  # Get the page
  if requests.get(url).reason != "OK":
    return f"Error, on url: {url} the server returns: {requests.get(url).reason}"
  else:
    # Format the page with BeautifulSoup
    formated_page = bs4.BeautifulSoup(page.text,"lxml")

    # Here we are looking for a title of the book ranked with two stars
      # So all a tags under h3 tags which are immidiately after the p with "star-rating and Two" classes which are in the element with "product_pod" class
    titles = formated_page.select(".product_pod > p.star-rating.Two + h3 > a")
    # Function returns list of matched titles from the page
    return [ title["title"] for title in titles]

titles_with_2_star_rating = []

# We do need to scrape whole catalog (50 pages)
  # Logic in link building is https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-[1 - 50].html
  # So we are looping the link with page-1 to 50

for num in range(1,51):
  result = get_stuff(f"https://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-{num}.html")
  titles_with_2_star_rating.extend(result)
```

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1508203192714252289)


### Day 63: March 28th, 2022
Another day on the web page scraping topic in Python where I was practicing on the [tosrape](https://toscrape.com/) page again this time on the qoutes sandbox. Had a challange list from the course I was following where ultimately I had to scape qoute authors from all available pages. 

Similar as yesterday but this time I've made it more robust by having a validation for pages without content where the loop would break. Very interesting topic - next I will spend some time on basics of networking with Python.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1508543866659553281)


### Day 64: March 30th, 2022
Half a day yesterday, day and a half today, let's call it a day :) So, networking and web services in Python - socket, urllib and bit of a XML. Played a bit with fetching data from web servers and parsing xml. Blown away on the sheer fact how Python makes it easy.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1509270975644377091)


### Day 65: March 31st, 2022
Today I worked with JSON and read about using Google Map and Twitter APIs. Then started pushing FreeCodeCamp's Python course and solved around 10% more of topics which brings me to 70%. A bit more of a theoretical session but gotta have those too. Very tired so keeping this one shorter than usual.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1509633919636938762)


### Day 66: April 2nd, 2022
Skipped a day yesterday, continued today. Solved few more topics from the FreeCodeCamp's Python course and completed OOP part of the course, reached 80% of completion. Then worked with images using pillow library and learned how to manipulate them. Also around 80% from the Udemy's course so I'm on a good track. Next topic - pfd and spreadsheets in Python.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1510271328355561472)


### Day 67: April 3rd, 2022
Today I worked with CSV and PDF files in Python and learned basics of csv and pyPDF2 libraries.
Had a great challenge from the Udemy course, solution [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_2/data_digging2.py).

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1510724401100201998)


### Day 68: April 4th, 2022
Today I was working with emails in Python - how to send them and how to read them, where I learned basics of smtplib, imaplib and email libraries.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1511076407799160834)


### Day 69: April 6th, 2022
Skipped a day yesterday - today contiuend with the FCC Python course where I worked a bit with databases. It eneded up to be a short SQL crash course but since that will be the topic I'll explore later in more depth, kept it short and sweet.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1511802006058545155)


### Day 70: April 7th, 2022
Got to the very end of both courses I've been following - Udemy's Complete Python Bootcamp and FreeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python. Now to the projects - 5 of them in the FCC's course and one more of a freestyle challenge on the other one. So, next few day I'll be having fun.

### Day 71: April 8th, 2022
Started with FreeCodeCamp challenges today - first one was Arithmetic Formatter where the function will take a list of lists with arithmetic statements and format it so it prints them in columns. It took more time than I thought it will but it was fun.

### Day 73: April 11th, 2022
Started working on the third challenge from the FreeCodeCamp's Python course called "Budget App" where the aim is to create class for budget category with associated methods and a chart function outside of the template to create a sorted bar graph of all expanses.

Completed the class and arithmeic part of the graph function, tomorrow will tackle the visual output.

### Day 76: April 18th, 2022
Few days off around Easter, it's getting harder and harder to find time and discipline during holidays so I took few days off and started working yesterday on my 5th and final froject from the FCC's Python course. Since I was not able to finish it yesterday, figured I'll complete it today and count everything as one day. So it was, and I spent two hours fixing my logic trying different things to compare two lists and nothing worked until I found that I am measuring lenght of a wrong list in my result. So.. yeah, gotta start working on my focusing.

Python course completed, another check box ticked in my broad goals - next thing, Liknedin profile. Then databases.

### Day 77: April 21st, 2022
It took me two days to write a decent LinkedIn profile but I finally managed to do it. So, counting this as one day as I really want to push as much of databases possible in this challenge round.

### Day 78: April 22nd, 2022
Today I used the time to research database and SQL materials which I'll be learning from in the next days and decided to do these two in paralel:

* [Udemy's Complete SQL and Databases Bootcamp: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-sql-databases-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery/)
* [FreeCodeCamp's Relational Databases](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/)

Eventhough I will not be able to complete either of them during the course of this round, they will cover few of the important topics I planned to do so I will try to complete History of Data and SQL Fundamentals from the Udemy's course and Basic Bash scripting from the FCC's course during this round and leave rest for the summer when I'm planning to start the third round of the challenge.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1517613680187346945)


### Day 79: April 23rd, 2022
Started with [Udemy's Complete SQL and Databases Bootcamp: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-sql-databases-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery/) course and got through first two section which were bit of a chatty introduction with some interesting history. Learned that the database icon of stacked circles is actualy a representation of an early drum disk which was used before modern hard disks were invented.

Then started third module dealing with SQL and wrote few simple queries. Still not sure if this will be the right course for me but let's see in the following days. Plan is to complete the third section which is basics of SQL, then start with the FCC's course.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1517983116035506177)


### Day 80: April 24th, 2022
Continued with the Udemy's course and the third module, more history lessons, bare basics of SQL and somo explodation of the database models where I learned about hierarchical, network and relational modes and how they were fixing the previous one's problems. Still not 100% about the course, will complete this section and then decide if I'll go for something less chatty and more practical.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1518325124000268290)


### Day 81: April 25th, 2022
Continued with the Udemy's course and completed the third module which was dealing with some basic theory around databases, relational model and the database management systems and the SQL itself. Then started with the fourth module which is concerning the setup. Course proposes PostGresSQL database with the ValentinaDB Studio management system - will use PgAdmin rather as that one seems to be more commonly used and I already saw it in my company on few ocasions. I've decided to do this course on Windows platform as I'll do Linux extensivly on the FreecOdeCAmp's one.

### Day 82: April 28th, 2022
Had a 2 day break, actually one skipped day and some read about the SQL yesterday which I'm not counting as a day. So today I changed the course to [The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go from Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/) as this one is more practical, less chatty and without overusing the analogies so I finally moved on - will revise previous course on the topic of database design once I'm done with the basics and the SQL. 

So, configured my enviroment - will do PostgreSQL as a dbms and pgAdmin as a gui client to manage it. Started with basics of SQL - `SELECT`, `SELECT DISTINCT` and `SELECT WHERE`.
