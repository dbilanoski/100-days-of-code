### Day 1: January 10th, 2022
Dusted off my GitHub account, sorted this repo a bit and started with round 2 files. Made a plan and I am ready to start - it's you and me, unfinished business from 2020 :) 

Completed ES6 chapter from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with JS promises. Next stop - Regular Expressions. 

While preparing this, had a good refresher of Markdown syntax and bit of a "starting a new challeng" rush. Felt quite nice. Ofcourse, it took me more time to write a Twitter post than entry to this journal, so..jeah, same old same old.git

### Day 2: January 11th, 2022
Started regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of patteren making, character sets and flags. Regular expressions were always hard to read for me, so I decided to spend more time on this topic and have another go at it tomorrow. 

Not a bad session overall.

### Day 3: January 12th, 2022
Completed regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of grouping and combining patterns with "or" operators. Kind of rushed it as I only had little time between putting my kid to sleep and rushing to the semi night shift maintenance windows at work.

Need to try to manage time better.

### Day 4: January 13th, 2022
Completed the debugging chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of debugging in the browser console, checking the code for spelling/syntax errors and escaping infinite loops.

Did not learn anything new but had a brief refresher + one more chapter of the course completed.

### Day 5: January 15th, 2022
Skipped a day yesterday so pushed almost two hours today to compensate. Completed the Basic Data Structures chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of arrays, objects and associated methods.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1482471615946502148)

### Day 6: January 16th, 2022
Started and went through about a third of Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). This chapter had some real challanges so it was fun. Worked with arrays and writing logic for reshaping, sorting and filtering.

This one will will return the lenght if the longest word in a sentence and it's all mine :) 

```
function findLongestWordLenght(str) {
  let arr = str.split(" ");
  let max = 0;

  for(let i = 0; i <= arr.length-1; i++) {
    let len = arr[i].length;
    
    if(max < len) {
      max = len;
    }
  }

  return max;
}
```

### Day 7: January 17th, 2022
Went through another third of Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and had a really good time with simple string and array algorithms for changing words and filtering sentences.

Also a good refresher on some strign and array methods which I forgot. I forgot a lot.

### Day 8: January 18th, 2022
Completed Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and had more fun with array filtering and mutating simple algorithms.

I was poorely motivated and had a hard time keeping focus so it took more time than necessary + I had to google alot again. Need to work on my sleep quality and stress management.

### Day 9: January 19th, 2022
Went through most of the Object Oriented Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with object, constructors, and prototype chain. Kept it a bit shorter than usual as it's my birthday.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1483937160436793350)

### Day 10: January 20th, 2022
Completed Object Oriented Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked more with objects and inheritance. Not a particulary productive day as I was poorely motivated and lacking iterest in the topic but pushed through it. Solid refresher at the end.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1484266459639525376)

### Day 11: January 22th, 2022
Skipped a day as yesterday I did to little to count it as a day, so pushed a bit harder today to compensate. Completed Functional Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I mostly worked with array methods and had a few suprising challenges. Great chapter overall.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1484923510287912964)

### Day 12: January 23rd, 2022
Started Intermediate Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through about one fourth of the challenges. Mostly worked with arrays and objects and had to google a bit about regex and object methods. 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1485300427402928137)

### Day 13: January 24rd, 2022
Completed almonst 50% of Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with strings, arrays and more tricky games with rearranging words and letters - had a great time and spent a lot of time.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1485730404715962368)

### Day 14: January 26th, 2022
Skipped another day due to being exausted and not having time to do much. Pushed bit more today and completed Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) I did have to Google alot especially for the math challenges but ultimately produced results. This was a very good insight into how much I still don't know and need to learn.

### Day 15: January 27th, 2022
Started final projects in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I solved two - paliendrome checker & ruman numerals conventer. I spent almost two hours on the roman numerals and after a solid session of while loops and If statemens, I checked Google a bit and saw a simpler implementation of my own logic. Bit of a cheat, but I did understand it.

```
function convertToRoman(numb) {
  const mappings = {
    M:  1000,
    CM: 900,
    D:  500,
    CD: 400,
    C:  100,
    XC: 90,
    L:  50,
    XL: 40,
    X:  10,
    IX: 9,
    V:  5,
    IV: 4,
    I:  1,
  };  

  let result = '';
  
  for (let key in mappings) {
    while(num <= 0) {
      result+= key;
      num -= mappings[key];
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

### Day 16: January 28th, 2022
Continued with final projects in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Today I took it easy and solved one project, the "Caesars Cipher" with the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) substitution cipher which I solved completely by myself, without even looking at JS documentation, using most basic of functions - for loops and if statemes. It was a blast.

```
function rot13(str) {
  const alphabet="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".split("");
  const string = str.slice().toUpperCase().split("");
  let decodedString =[];

  for(let i = 0; i <= string.length-1; i++) {
    let index = alphabet.indexOf(string[i]);
    
    if(index == -1) {
      decodedString.push(string[i]);
    } else if(index < 13) {
        decodedString.push(alphabet[index+13]);
    } else {
        decodedString.push(alphabet[index-13]);
    }
  }
return decodedString.join("");

}
```

### Day 17: January 29th, 2022
Continued with final projects in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I completed one focusing on the regex usage and it was great as it forced me to look up regex documentation once again. Finally, I can say I'm feeling a bit more confortable with regexes in general and understand them better. Last project from the course I also started but leaving it for tomorrow.

Validation of the US telephone numbers I wrote:

```
function telephoneCheck(str) {
  const usPhonePattern = /^(?:\d{3}|\(\d{3}\)|1\s?\d{3}|1\s?\(\d{3}\))(?:\-|\s)?\d{3}(?:\-|\s)?\d{4}$/;

  return usPhonePattern.test(str);
 
}
```

### Day 18: January 29th, 2022
Completed the "Cash register" final project in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) after more than 2 hours of covering all cases. Take that, unifinished business from 2020!

Gonna use next session to find good Python material to start learning basic sytnax and scripting there before I move to the databases.

Cash register solution

```
function checkCashRegister(price, cash, cid) {
  /* Money units in cents to escape math with decimals */
  let currency = {
    "ONE HUNDRED": 10000,
    "TWENTY": 2000,
    "TEN": 1000,
    "FIVE": 500,
    "ONE": 100,
    "QUARTER": 25,
    "DIME": 10,
    "NICKEL": 5,
    "PENNY": 1
  }

  /* How much the change is */
  let change = (cash * 100) - (price *100);

  /* How much money is in the drawer */
  let cidSum = 0;

  for (let elem of cid) {
    cidSum += elem[1] * 100;
  }

  /* Main logic cases */

  if(change > cidSum) {
    /* IF more to return that in drawer, return insufficiend funds */
    return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []};

  } else if (change == cidSum) {
      /* If we have exact money to return, return closed with change as cid */
      return {status: "CLOSED", change: cid};

  } else {
    /* Other cases where we have enough money to return change and need to update the drawer content */
    cid = cid.reverse();
    let returnedChange = [];

    /* Looping through the change drawer*/
    for (let elem of cid) {
      elem[1] = elem[1]*100

      /* Looping the currency to match appropriate money units we are taking from the drawer to return change and if there are any */
      let returnedCurrency = [elem[0], 0];
      while (change >= currency[elem[0]] && elem[1] > 1) {

        /* Decrement change and current drawer money unit as you return money */
        change -= currency[elem[0]];
        elem[1] -= currency[elem[0]];

        /* Add returned money units to the array returned to original currency (divided by 100) */
        returnedCurrency[1] += currency[elem[0]]/100;
      } 
      /* Push to the totals array */
      returnedChange.push(returnedCurrency);
      };

    if (change > 0) {
      return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []};
    }

    return {status: "OPEN", change: returnedChange.filter(current => current[1] !== 0)};
  }
}
```
