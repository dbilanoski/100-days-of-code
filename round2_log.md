### Day 1: January 10th, 2022
Dusted off my GitHub account, sorted this repo a bit and started with round 2 files. Made a plan and I am ready to start - it's you and me, unfinished business from 2020 :) 

Completed ES6 chapter from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with JS promises. Next stop - Regular Expressions. 

While preparing this, had a good refresher of Markdown syntax and bit of a "starting a new challeng" rush. Felt quite nice. Ofcourse, it took me more time to write a Twitter post than entry to this journal, so..jeah, same old same old.git 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1480659476017553410)

### Day 2: January 11th, 2022
Started regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of patteren making, character sets and flags. Regular expressions were always hard to read for me, so I decided to spend more time on this topic and have another go at it tomorrow. 

Not a bad session overall.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1481031039090937860)

### Day 3: January 12th, 2022
Completed regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of grouping and combining patterns with "or" operators. Kind of rushed it as I only had little time between putting my kid to sleep and rushing to the semi night shift maintenance windows at work.

Need to try to manage time better.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1481379638760857605)

### Day 4: January 13th, 2022
Completed the debugging chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of debugging in the browser console, checking the code for spelling/syntax errors and escaping infinite loops.

Did not learn anything new but had a brief refresher + one more chapter of the course completed.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1481737603128999938)

### Day 5: January 15th, 2022
Skipped a day yesterday so pushed almost two hours today to compensate. Completed the Basic Data Structures chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of arrays, objects and associated methods.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1482471615946502148)

### Day 6: January 16th, 2022
Started and went through about a third of Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). This chapter had some real challanges so it was fun. Worked with arrays and writing logic for reshaping, sorting and filtering.

This one will will return the lenght if the longest word in a sentence and it's all mine :) 

```
function findLongestWordLenght(str) {
  let arr = str.split(" ");
  let max = 0;

  for(let i = 0; i <= arr.length-1; i++) {
    let len = arr[i].length;
    
    if(max < len) {
      max = len;
    }
  }

  return max;
}
```

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1482854591498752004)

### Day 7: January 17th, 2022
Went through another third of Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and had a really good time with simple string and array algorithms for changing words and filtering sentences.

Also a good refresher on some strign and array methods which I forgot. I forgot a lot.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1483192458355916806)

### Day 8: January 18th, 2022
Completed Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and had more fun with array filtering and mutating simple algorithms.

I was poorely motivated and had a hard time keeping focus so it took more time than necessary + I had to google alot again. Need to work on my sleep quality and stress management.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1483577901706530829)

### Day 9: January 19th, 2022
Went through most of the Object Oriented Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with object, constructors, and prototype chain. Kept it a bit shorter than usual as it's my birthday.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1483937160436793350)

### Day 10: January 20th, 2022
Completed Object Oriented Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked more with objects and inheritance. Not a particulary productive day as I was poorely motivated and lacking iterest in the topic but pushed through it. Solid refresher at the end.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1484266459639525376)

### Day 11: January 22th, 2022
Skipped a day as yesterday I did to little to count it as a day, so pushed a bit harder today to compensate. Completed Functional Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I mostly worked with array methods and had a few suprising challenges. Great chapter overall.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1484923510287912964)

### Day 12: January 23rd, 2022
Started Intermediate Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through about one fourth of the challenges. Mostly worked with arrays and objects and had to google a bit about regex and object methods. 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1485300427402928137)

### Day 13: January 24rd, 2022
Completed almonst 50% of Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with strings, arrays and more tricky games with rearranging words and letters - had a great time and spent a lot of time.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1485730404715962368)

### Day 14: January 26th, 2022
Skipped another day due to being exausted and not having time to do much. Pushed bit more today and completed Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) I did have to Google alot especially for the math challenges but ultimately produced results. This was a very good insight into how much I still don't know and need to learn.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1486443885874368526)

### Day 15: January 27th, 2022
Started final projects in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I solved two - paliendrome checker & ruman numerals conventer. I spent almost two hours on the roman numerals and after a solid session of while loops and If statemens, I checked Google a bit and saw a simpler implementation of my own logic. Bit of a cheat, but I did understand it.

```
function convertToRoman(numb) {
  const mappings = {
    M:  1000,
    CM: 900,
    D:  500,
    CD: 400,
    C:  100,
    XC: 90,
    L:  50,
    XL: 40,
    X:  10,
    IX: 9,
    V:  5,
    IV: 4,
    I:  1,
  };  

  let result = '';
  
  for (let key in mappings) {
    while(num <= 0) {
      result+= key;
      num -= mappings[key];
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

### Day 16: January 28th, 2022
Continued with final projects in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Today I took it easy and solved one project, the "Caesars Cipher" with the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) substitution cipher which I solved completely by myself, without even looking at JS documentation, using most basic of functions - for loops and if statemes. It was a blast.

```
function rot13(str) {
  const alphabet="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".split("");
  const string = str.slice().toUpperCase().split("");
  let decodedString =[];

  for(let i = 0; i <= string.length-1; i++) {
    let index = alphabet.indexOf(string[i]);
    
    if(index == -1) {
      decodedString.push(string[i]);
    } else if(index < 13) {
        decodedString.push(alphabet[index+13]);
    } else {
        decodedString.push(alphabet[index-13]);
    }
  }
return decodedString.join("");

}
```

### Day 17: January 29th, 2022
Continued with final projects in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I completed one focusing on the regex usage and it was great as it forced me to look up regex documentation once again. Finally, I can say I'm feeling a bit more confortable with regexes in general and understand them better. Last project from the course I also started but leaving it for tomorrow.

Validation of the US telephone numbers I wrote:

```
function telephoneCheck(str) {
  const usPhonePattern = /^(?:\d{3}|\(\d{3}\)|1\s?\d{3}|1\s?\(\d{3}\))(?:\-|\s)?\d{3}(?:\-|\s)?\d{4}$/;

  return usPhonePattern.test(str);
 
}
```
[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1487528736102756356)

### Day 18: January 29th, 2022
Completed the "Cash register" final project in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) after more than 2 hours of covering all cases. Take that, unifinished business from 2020!

Gonna use next session to find good Python material to start learning basic sytnax and scripting there before I move to the databases.

Cash register solution

```
function checkCashRegister(price, cash, cid) {
  /* Money units in cents to escape math with decimals */
  let currency = {
    "ONE HUNDRED": 10000,
    "TWENTY": 2000,
    "TEN": 1000,
    "FIVE": 500,
    "ONE": 100,
    "QUARTER": 25,
    "DIME": 10,
    "NICKEL": 5,
    "PENNY": 1
  }

  /* How much the change is */
  let change = (cash * 100) - (price *100);

  /* How much money is in the drawer */
  let cidSum = 0;

  for (let elem of cid) {
    cidSum += elem[1] * 100;
  }

  /* Main logic cases */

  if(change > cidSum) {
    /* IF more to return that in drawer, return insufficiend funds */
    return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []};

  } else if (change == cidSum) {
      /* If we have exact money to return, return closed with change as cid */
      return {status: "CLOSED", change: cid};

  } else {
    /* Other cases where we have enough money to return change and need to update the drawer content */
    cid = cid.reverse();
    let returnedChange = [];

    /* Looping through the change drawer*/
    for (let elem of cid) {
      elem[1] = elem[1]*100

      /* Looping the currency to match appropriate money units we are taking from the drawer to return change and if there are any */
      let returnedCurrency = [elem[0], 0];
      while (change >= currency[elem[0]] && elem[1] > 1) {

        /* Decrement change and current drawer money unit as you return money */
        change -= currency[elem[0]];
        elem[1] -= currency[elem[0]];

        /* Add returned money units to the array returned to original currency (divided by 100) */
        returnedCurrency[1] += currency[elem[0]]/100;
      } 
      /* Push to the totals array */
      returnedChange.push(returnedCurrency);
      };

    if (change > 0) {
      return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []};
    }

    return {status: "OPEN", change: returnedChange.filter(current => current[1] !== 0)};
  }
}
```

### Day 19: January 31th, 2022
Used today's session to review my goals and check online content for learning Python as I decided I will do that next while I'm still "warm" from the JavaScript Course. Plan is to learn basic Python syntax and use cases and test it as a tool for automating everyday computer tasks at work before I continue to databases and preparations for the DevOps tools.

I decided to go with the [Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp) and parallel to that I will do the FreeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) if I manage to squize it. Important thing to remember here is that I do not want to stuck on this topic - just learn enough to be able to test the language and to be able to easy dig in later if I need it. And from what I see in the trends, I'll need it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1488276940905926658)

### Day 20: February 1st, 2022
Started [Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp), went through introductory explanations, installed Anaconda3 suite but also prepared VS Code for Python as that is what I'll rather use. All set to learn, I started with the basic data structures and already wrote dozen of unnecessary semicolons.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1488632443250913281)

### Day 21: February 2nd, 2022
Continued with basic data structures in Python, did strings and lists today and explored some of their methods. Interesting, `list.sort()` just sorts the list, not returning it sorted - meaning, you can't do `new_list = list.sort()`, first you sort it, then do the `new_list = list` for example. Interesting language.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1488993041671237640)

### Day 22: February 3rd, 2022
Continued with basic data structures and associated methonds in Python. Today was a bit slower seesion as I was tired and already squized but managed to go thruugh dictionaries, tuples, sets, booleans and basic IO which I'll need to revise tomorrow. Not that much of a productive session but I kept on for an hour.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1489359950866440195)

### Day 23: February 4th, 2022
Completed basic data structures and objects in Python which was first module of the course I'm taking. There was a solid school like test at the end - not a big fan of the method but nailed it ;) I do hope future assessments will be project based.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1489714603647029255)


### Day 24: February 6th, 2022
Skipped a day as yesterday I felt it was not enough to call it a day. Then today had even less time to do anything, so two half days, let's say it was a day. And a lousy one. Seems weekends are hardest to do anything these days. So, control flow - if, elif, else, for loops and while loops. Digging the syntax for this gotta say.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1490456078693416960)

### Day 25: February 7th, 2022
Completed second module of the Python course where I worked with control flow logic and iteration.  Today I reviewed useful functions for working with lists and for loops (such as `enumerate()`) and list comprehension way of writing for loops which basicly flattens the for loop. Gotta say it's weird and not that intuitive at first.

```
# Example

my_list = [current for current in "Hello"]

# is same as

my_list = []
for current in "Hello":
  my_list.append(current)

# Output: ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
```

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1490831529961873411)


### Day 26: February 8th, 2022
Little detour today as I had an opportunity to solve a problem at work by using Python so I took a swing at it.
Idea is to have a simple downloader script which authenticates to Google Cloud service and pulls files from the storage bucket. Luckly, there are pretty convenient libraries for that. 

Little less luckly, I had to reinstall my Python setup, troubleshoot missing PIP modules which were actually installed and write code blind as I did not have service keys and needed info to test my script. On the bright side - it was fun, I tried Try and Except statements and actually reinforced some concepts learned in the previous lesson.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1491176557289021449)

### Day 27: February 9th, 2022
Worked a bit more on my Google Storage downloader script then continued with the course where I started learning functions and methods. Basics today, wrote a simple calculator function. Really liking the syntax.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1491532412626649100)

### Day 28: February 11th, 2022
Skipped a day again, this time I was too tired and just was not able to follow anything. Today did a bit better but under same conditions. Continued with functions, did few examples with tuples and tuples unpacking. Tried appening to lists using Javascript methonds ofcourse :D 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1492250996503949315)


### Day 29: February 12th, 2022
Today I did good - managed to spend almost three hours on function excercizes solving simple problems in Python. Tomorrow round 2 :)
```
# ALMOST THERE 
  # Given an integer n, return True if n is within 10 of either 100 or 200

  # almost_there(90) --> True
  # almost_there(104) --> True
  # almost_there(150) --> False
  # almost_there(209) --> True

def almost_there(n):
  n = abs(n)
  r1 = range(90,111)
  r2 = range (190,211)

  if n in r1 or n in r2:
    return True
  else:
    pass
  
  return False
```

### Day 30: February 13th, 2022
Another good day, little less productive but still good. Round two of solving simple challenges in Python where aim was to get confortable with functions. Spent almost an hour on one which lists prime numbers from an range. Actually I am kind of proud as I had good logic but got stuck on second loop printing all odd numbers instead of primes. Then I saw few examples and figured I need a flag to make sure only prime number gets appended in the first loop. Good times :) 

```
def count_primes(num):
  primes = [] # Initialize empty list
  for n in range(2,num+1): # Looping from 2 (first prime number) to our feeded number
    is_prime = True # Status flag to flag if number is prime
    for i in range(2,n): # Another loop from 2 to current number from the first loop
      if (n % i) == 0: 
         is_prime = False # In case number is divisible, status flag is false
      else:
        pass
    if is_prime == True: # Back to the first loop - if flag is true, append number to list since it's prime number
      primes.append(n)
    else:
      pass

  print(primes)
  return len(primes)

```
[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1492977593775185923)

### Day 31: February 14th, 2022
Today I was a bit less productive but took the chance to check on web solutions for challenges I was solving last two days to see how syntax and logic can improve. While doing it, I figured how to make my initial function for checking primes without any flags from yesterday work - FOR ELSE statement. Started a bit with map() and filter() methods but will leave it for tomorrow.

```
# My original logic without the flag, it was not working because I was unaware of the posibility to have an For - Else statement
def count_primes_2(num):
  primes = []
  for n in range(2,num+1):
    for i in range(2,n):
      if n % i == 0:
        break
    else:
      primes.append(n)

  print(primes)
  return len(primes)
```
[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1493353014853312512)

### Day 32: February 16th, 2022
Skipped another day as yesterday, even though I did learn for more than an hour, I did not feel like I finished the topic so it made more sense to finish it today. So, yesterday and today I worked with lambda expressions, `map()` and `filter()` methods and read about scope in Python where I tested on few examples the LEGB lookup order of checking the variable assigment.

**LEGB Rule**

Order of resolving variable names in Python.
* L - local, names assigned within a def or lambda function and not declared global in that function
* E - enclosing function locals, names in the local scope of any function, from inner to outer
* G - global, names assigned at the top lovel of a module file or declared global in a def within the file
* B - built-in Python, names preassigned in the built-in names module

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1494067354740928512)

### Day 33: February 17th, 2022
Another round of practicing functions with challenges in Python, good session.

```
# Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not. (Assume the string passed in does not have any punctuation)
  # Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
  # For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

import string

def ispangram(str1, alphabet=string.ascii_lowercase):
  prep = set(str1.replace(" ","").lower())
  alph = set(alphabet)
 
  return prep.issuperset(alph)

```

### Day 34: February 19th, 2022
Skipped a day as yesterday I needed a day off. Today started with the first bigger project, Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. Lets see :) 


[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1495150907864014849)
