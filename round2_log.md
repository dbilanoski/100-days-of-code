### Day 1: January 10th, 2022
Dusted off my GitHub account, sorted this repo a bit and started with round 2 files. Made a plan and I am ready to start - it's you and me, unfinished business from 2020 :) 

Completed ES6 chapter from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with JS promises. Next stop - Regular Expressions. 

While preparing this, had a good refresher of Markdown syntax and bit of a "starting a new challeng" rush. Felt quite nice. Ofcourse, it took me more time to write a Twitter post than entry to this journal, so..jeah, same old same old.git

### Day 2: January 11th, 2022
Started regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of patteren making, character sets and flags. Regular expressions were always hard to read for me, so I decided to spend more time on this topic and have another go at it tomorrow. 

Not a bad session overall.

### Day 3: January 12th, 2022
Completed regex chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of grouping and combining patterns with "or" operators. Kind of rushed it as I only had little time between putting my kid to sleep and rushing to the semi night shift maintenance windows at work.

Need to try to manage time better.

### Day 4: January 13th, 2022
Completed the debugging chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of debugging in the browser console, checking the code for spelling/syntax errors and escaping infinite loops.

Did not learn anything new but had a brief refresher + one more chapter of the course completed.

### Day 5: January 15th, 2022
Skipped a day yesterday so pushed almost two hours today to compensate. Completed the Basic Data Structures chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through basics of arrays, objects and associated methods.

### Day 6: January 16th, 2022
Started and went through about a third of Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). This chapter had some real challanges so it was fun. Worked with arrays and writing logic for reshaping, sorting and filtering.

This one will will return the lenght if the longest word in a sentence and it's all mine :) 

```
function findLongestWordLenght(str) {
  let arr = str.split(" ");
  let max = 0;

  for(let i = 0; i <= arr.length-1; i++) {
    let len = arr[i].length;
    
    if(max < len) {
      max = len;
    }
  }

  return max;
}
```

### Day 7: January 17th, 2022
Went through another third of Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and had a really good time with simple string and array algorithms for changing words and filtering sentences.

Also a good refresher on some strign and array methods which I forgot. I forgot a lot.

### Day 8: January 18th, 2022
Completed Basic Algorithm Scripting chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and had more fun with array filtering and mutating simple algorithms.

I was poorely motivated and had a hard time keeping focus so it took more time than necessary + I had to google alot again. Need to work on my sleep quality and stress management.

### Day 9: January 19th, 2022
Went through most of the Object Oriented Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with object, constructors, and prototype chain. Kept it a bit shorter than usual as it's my birthday.

### Day 10: January 20th, 2022
Completed Object Oriented Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked more with objects and inheritance. Not a particulary productive day as I was poorely motivated and lacking iterest in the topic but pushed through it. Solid refresher at the end.

### Day 11: January 22th, 2022
Skipped a day as yesterday I did to little to count it as a day, so pushed a bit harder today to compensate. Completed Functional Programming chapter in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I mostly worked with array methods and had a few suprising challenges. Great chapter overall.

### Day 12: January 23rd, 2022
Started Intermediate Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I went through about one fourth of the challenges. Mostly worked with arrays and objects and had to google a bit about regex and object methods.

### Day 13: January 24rd, 2022
Completed almonst 50% of Algorithm Scripting module in the JS course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) where I worked with strings, arrays and more tricky games with rearranging words and letters - had a great time and spent a lot of time.
