### Day 1: January 1st, 2020
Made a plan, evaluated my knowledge and sorted literature and courses I will take in first quarter of this challenge. Prepared GitHub journal repo and fooled around in Firefox Console with some basic JavaScript. Still got them, basics :)

While preparing this, learned some Markdown syntax.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2020
Today I started with [Kevin Powell's Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/g/gresponsive) with a plan to revisit and recall HTML, CSS & Responsive design principles and almost at the end of first module, I can say I made a good choice of course literature.

**Topics I covered:**
- Box model
- Inline VS block elements
- Margin & padding, collapsing margins especially
    - Interesting thing, if we set margin-top to first child element in some HTML box, that margin will become parent's top-margin
- Link states and how to style them properly
    - Interesting thing, five states of anchor tag, never heard of a:link state
    - Seems to me that best practice is to set styles for "a" in general, then style a:hover and a:focus
- Small blog-post card project to practise

**Note:** Scrimba was not working for me, code written in the service's playground was not rendering to mini browser inside so I finished the exercise on CodePen.
