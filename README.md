# Hi there. I've  joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge
> but actually planning to do the whole year. And it's a leap year ;)

## Introduction
This repository will serve as a public journal of my challenge progress with main commitment - to code for at least an our every day for next <s>366 days</s> 100 days.

In this run, my goal is to revisit what I knew before and learn what I need to know to become job ready for the frontend developer position by the end of the year.

## Rules
1. Code a minimum of half hour every day for the next 366 days
2. Tweet the progress daily with hashtags:
    - #100DaysOfCode
    - #301DaysOfCode
    - #365DaysOfCode
    - #366DaysOfCode
3. Push the code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see the progress
    - If pushing to GitHub is not applicable, provide a description of that day's work with link to a tweet or relevant screenshot
4. Update the "Log" file with the day's progress and include link or screenshot of that day's work

## Rounds 
**Round One (January 1st 2020 - April 29th 2020)** - log available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/log.md)

## Note
This repo is heavily inspired by Alexander Kallaway's 100-days-of-code project which I strongly recommend checking out.
