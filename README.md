# Hi there. I've  joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge
> but actually planning to do the whole year. And it's a leap year ;)

## Introduction
This repository will serve as a public journal of my progress with the main commitment - to code/learn for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.

This challenge I initially started as a whole-year challenge but later changed it to a regular round based 100 days of code challenge as this way it seems to be more manageable, practical, concrete and repeatable. Rounds are described below under ["Rounds"](#rounds) with links to separate rounds journals where the daily progress of a particular round is documented.

## Rules
1. Code or learn technology related topics for a minimum of hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet the progress daily with appropriate hashtags, such as:
    - #100DaysOfCode
    - #301DaysOfCode
    - #365DaysOfCode
    - #366DaysOfCode
3. Log daily progress in this journal and push it to GitHub every day
    - Daily log entry should have a link to the posted tweet
    - In case there was a coding project, challenge or snippet finished during the session, it will be saved as a separate file under exercises directory in this journal
