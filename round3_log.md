### Day 1: January 11th, 2023
Starting the third round of the challenge and as usual, took the first day to plot my goals, sort the literature and make a learning plan.

I'll start with [Harvard CS50 Youtube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710) and then it will be all about the Linux and relational databases. But first things first - learn and test the Obsidian markdown editor.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1613283170513833985)


### Day 2: January 12th, 2023
Checked the Obsidian today and gotta say it's a fantastic markdown editor so will start my technical notes and docs there. Key will be to use it just for that specific purpose or otherwise it's just another platform for dashboarding your life.

Created cheat-sheets GitHub repo for tech notes and shortcuts. Tomorrow, I start with Harward CS50 Youtube course.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1613650326522929157)


### Day 3: January 13th, 2023
Started with [Harvard CS50 Youtube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710) and the first lecture which covered basics of computing such as numerical systems, mapping standards, algorithms and pseudo code. This will be fun as it's pure theory for 24 hours.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1614000797616078848)

### Day 4: January 14th, 2023
Checked the CS50 course a bit deeper and decided to enroll and do the official one [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/). So, this one will take me more time than planned in this round as I will have projects, different programming languages etc. but looks like a good introduction to computer science and an opportunity for me to play with the C lanugage.

Today I completed the week 0 lecture which was about core concepts and fundamentals of programing languages and a walktrough of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a visual block based programming language for kids and beginners. So first project will bi in Scatch and probably I'll do some version of [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) game.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1614385973290221569)


### Day 5: January 15th, 2023
Today I started with first project in Scatch. I decided to do a simpler version of Space Invaders and I spent 2 hours making small aliens and spaceship sprites and choosing sound effects. This will take longer then I planned :D 


[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1614759462425731074)

### Day 6: January 16th, 2023
Completed my [Space Intruders](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/789060336) game on Scratch. Next topic - C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1615124573397073924)


### Day 7: January 17th, 2023
Started Week1 lecture of CS50x where the topic will be C. Today was basics of it, compilers, variables, data types, etc.
Configured VS Code and local environment. Wrote fist hello, world.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1615462860725051393)


### Day 8: January 18th, 2023
Moving on with basics of C in CS50x - if statements, conditionals, nesting. Unfortunately, only an hour and a half today for this.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1615833258448625689)


### Day 9: January 19th, 2023
Today was more on data types, formatting, restrictions with numbers and defining functions. Lecture is over, next will be problem sets and challeges.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1616195467720921088)


### Day 10: January 22nd, 2023
Took the weekend off to celebrate my birthday, now back to it. Lab and half of the first problem set is done, will try to finish it completely tomorrow.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1617264128258703366)


### Day 11: January 23rd, 2023
Ok, today was good, managed to clear three out of four problem sets in CS50x week one lecture - Super Mario pyramid print, double pyramid print and the change counter greedy algorithm. 
Tomorrow I'll do the credid card algorithm and then off to week 2.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1617652242768883714)


### Day 12: January 25th, 2023
So, half a session yesterday but almost 2 hours today, so will count all of that as a day. 
Took me more than expected to do the credit card validation with Luhn algorithm in C working for all cases in CS50x but it was very interesting.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1618390227021856774)


### Day 13: January 26th, 2023
Refactored last challenge where I moved some functionalities to functions to practice writing them in C, ended up with 20 lines code less. 
Submitted CS50x week one challenges, ready for week 2.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1618710584706625538)


### Day 14: January 28th, 2023
Again, half of a session yesterday, fine session today - counting it as one day. Started week 2 lecture in CS50x with topics of compiling, debugging and arrays in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1619457305082466306)


### Day 15: January 31st, 2023
Skipped few days due to work, back to it. Finished CS50x Week 2 lesson with strings and string libraries in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1620526370458841089)


### Day 16: February 2nd, 2023
Had to skip another day due to home budgeting and finance revision, today back to it. Completed CS50x Week 2 lab where the task was to build a simple Scrabble game in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1621265954045939714)

### Day 17: February 4th, 2023
Today I was solving a "readability" problem in CS50x where I had to implement a scoring of a test based on the [Coleman-Liau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index) calculation in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1622002174128439297)


### Day 18: February 7th, 2023
It took me 2 days to solve the "bulbs" problem in CS50x where the main point was decimal to binary conversion. Two things I learned - working with multidimension arrays and that I forgot basic math :D

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1623091736560934913)


### Day 19: February 8th, 2023
Solved the "Substitution" problem set in CS50x Week 2 section where the task was to accept a specific key and encrypt given string based on it in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1623460995363471361)


### Day 20: February 11th, 2023
Spend 2 sessions on troubleshooting why CS50x is not accepting my solution to the "Caesar" problem. Turns out they were counting on printing letters directly from the loop while I was appending those to a string first and then printing the whole string at once. Since the string was [null terminated](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~davis/cpeg222/AssemblyTutorial/Chapter-20/ass20_2.html), it was a no go.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1624503424883490816)


### Day 21: February 13th, 2023
Completed last problem set in CS50x, Wordle50. Next chapter - algorithms.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1625254037003071504)


### Day 22: February 15th, 2023
Started Week 3 lecture in CS50x about algorithms where the topics were performace, big O\Ω\Θ notations and basic search algorithms. Also learnt how to define strucs in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1625972609178370176)


### Day 23: February 16th, 2023
Finished the Week 3 lecture in CS50x about algorithms where the topics were sorting algorithm, evaluating them and recursion. Gotta invest more time in understanding recursion before I jump to problem sets so tomorrow will be that.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1626343157188157441)


### Day 24: February 19th, 2023
Seems this round will be full of skipped days but it is what it is. Did a solid read/youtube watch on the recursion to understand it betted. It will probably click once I start doing some code with it. Completed Lab3 of CS50x Week 3 where I was benchmarking some sorting algorithms to see which is which.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1627424883880693760)

### Day 25: February 20th, 2023
Continued today with CS50x Week 3 problem sets and solved "Plurality". Took me way more time than needed as I started complicating with auxilery arrays to store results to while solution was rather simple - track the maksimum vote value and then, in another loop, print just those with that same value as a vote value.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1627795522323898368)

### Day 26: February 22nd, 2023
Yesterday and today I worked on a CS50x Week3 problem set called "runoff". Lesson to be learned here is that if you did not understand given data structure completely, you won't be able to write functions which handle/depend on it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1628511571633741824)

### Day 27: February 24th, 2023
Yesterday I worked a bit on the other CS50x Week 3 problem with a [Tideman method of ranked pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs), then today started Week 4 lecture which will be about memory. So half a work there, half a work here, let's call it a one day.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1629247688645521409)


### Day 28: February 27th, 2023
Took the weekend off. Back to it today - continued with CS50x Week 4 lecture where I was learning about pointers, strings and poking around memory in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1630320805216124930)


### Day 29: February 28th, 2023
Continued with CS50x Week 4 lecture and more about the memory - malloc, free, garbage values and how string are working in C. There is just 20 minutes of lecture left but calling it a day as concentration is low.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1630687404788006913)


### Day 30: March 3rd, 2023
Yesterday and today I finished the Week 4 lecture and completed both lab assigments. Got sick and the focus was low and hazy but managed to complete the assigments. Next - problem sets.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1631769813243576322)


### Day 31: March 5th, 2023
Skiped a day. Worked on the first problem set called filter where the task was to implement few types of image filtering types (blur, sephia etc.). Spent more time than needed figuring out why my reflection is returing same identical image - turns out if you go row by row, you need to stop swapping first-to-last pixel at the middle, otherwise you get same image :D Tomorrow I do blur, submit, then next one.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1632505797564411910)


### Day 32: March 8th, 2023
Ok so I was doing blur yesterday and today, and still struggling to visualize current pixel position. So will not post to Twitter and will give this a few more sessions.


### Day 33: March 11th, 2023
Finally got a pass on this one. Gotta admit, I spent almost a week and still had to tweak indexes on edge cases by almost guessing them to get the pass score as numbers were not spot on in the end. Really good challenge. I probably tried too hard visualizing pixels rather than writing the grid in a more mathematical way.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1634655845425217540)


### Day 34: March 12th, 2023
Started working on "Recover" pset from Week 4 where the task is to recover deleted jpegs from memory.
Got the main logic drafted, need to see smart way of delimiting images.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1635044939137716230)


### Day 35: March 14th, 2023
Yesterday I spent almost two hours troubleshooting a memory leak on "Recover" problem set from Week 4 CS50x lesson where te task was to implement a jpeg recovery program in C. Turned out I had an opened file reference inside a specific condition which I did not close. I was too tired to post, so today just a code cleanup and problem set submission. Next topic - Week 5 and the data structures.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1635752240009838592)


### Day 36: March 16th, 2023
Yesterday I took the day off as I had some other computer related task to finish so there was just no time. Today back to it - started Week 5 lecture about data structures in CS50x where the topics were stacks, queues and memory allocation and reallocation when expanding arrays. Next topic - linked lists.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1636484927762907137)


### Day 37: March 20th, 2023
Took the weekend of to play Diablo 4 as it was open beta weekend. Today back to it - continued with CS50x week 5 lecture where the topic was about liked lists.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1637941639577497600)


### Day 38: March 22nd, 2023
Skipped another day, I was just tired and not motivated so it had no sense counting that misery as a day. Pushed on today and completed Week 5 lesson where I learned about hash tables, dictionaries and tries. Next few sessions will be problem sets and labs.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1638661485336338432)


### Day 39: March 27th, 2023
Another weekend skipped due to Diablo4 open beta and general lack of concentration and motivation. Picked things up where I left them and completed Week 5 lap where the task was to write a blood type distribution logic between three generations practicing custom data types and recursion in C. Gotta say, recursion I am not confortable with still but getting grasp of it. Also, I noticed that if I leave C for few day, I forget the pointers and the star notation which probably means those things I did not understand completely. Will revisit those in the documentation and then procees with the problem set assignment.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1640449163249987585)


### Day 40: March 30th, 2023
Started working on the CS50x Week 5's problem set called spellchecker. One of those premade programs where I'm kinda jumping in to write the main functionality so I always need some time to understand what's the current logic and what's expected. In this one I'll have a chance to write my own hash function. Should be interesting.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1641532911215058952)


### Day 41: April 1st, 2023
Continued with the CS50x Week 5's problem set called spellchecker where I worked on the file reading and other supporting functions and left the hashing for the end. I noticed that I do need to check the examples and the documentation more often then with other stuff which tells me two things: 1. I probably did not understand referencing/pointer sintax in C that good and 2. I do keep skipping days so things are not sticking as usual.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1642287985449107456)


### Day 42: April 3rd, 2023
Completed the CS50x Week 5 problem set Spellchecker after 4 or 5 sessions. For the hashing function I went with the one I could actually write myself - sum of the letters ASCII values. Had to check the documentation and consult the lecture for the linked lists and string functions more than I wanted to so as I recognized in the last journal entry, these things require more disciplined approach, but nevertheless I leared alot and expanded my understanding. 

Final results of the function measuerements are significantly lower than the one provided by the Staff but I did write my hashing function by myself so feeling good about it. C was actually quite a journey and I firmly believe everybody should learn basics of it just to understand how data structures and memory management works.

Next topic - Python. Fun fun fun.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1643005090456907776)


### Day 43: April 4th, 2023
Started Week 6 lecture in CS50x where the topic is Python. Today was basics and few examples of C code written in Python. Took it easy, looking forward to projects.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1643363016715522048)


### Day 44: April 6th, 2023
Continued with the Python lecture in CS50x where there was talk about data types, conditionals, loops and functions.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1644072171742871553),


### Day 45: April 7th, 2023
Continued with the Python lecture in CS50x where there was talk about data types, string, methods and all sorts of random examples.
[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1645878731779579904)


### Day 46: April 11th, 2023
Completed the Python lecture with more random examples. Next, labs and problem sets.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1645878731779579904)


### Day 47: April 12th, 2023
Completed the CS50x Week 6 Lab assignment where the task was to implement some world cup simulation function with endgoal of calculation probability of winning based on the provided FIFA ratings.

### Day 61: May 11th, 2023
Completed a problem set called "fiftyville" form CS50x Week 7 lecture where I had to investigate a fu*king rubber duck robbery by querying a database. With that nonsense out of the way, SQL lecture is now finished.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1656787288318259202)


### Day 62: May 14th, 2023
Took the weekend off to rest and spend some time with friends and family, today back to it. Started CS50x Week 8 lecture where the topic will be HTML, CSS and JS. First hour was a bit of a history and the underlying technologies.

### Day 64: May 17th, 2023
Completed CS50x Week 8 lecture which overed CSS and JavaScript in less than an hour. Let that sink in a bit.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1658929451596382208)


### Day 65: May 19th, 2023
Completed CS50x Week 8 lab where I wrote a solid block of Javascript to provide basic functionality to a quiz like simple web page interface. Forgot how I actually enjoyed this language and never got a real chance to develop the skills in it. 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1659321223623372800)


### Day 66: May 23rd, 2023
Took the weekend off. Yesterday started working on final "homepage" project from CS50x Week 8 lecture. Should have been straightforward but then I saw using Bootstrap is a requirement so needed to look into that one too.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1661119166043115520)


### Day 67: May 25th, 2023
Finally done with the bootstrap homepage project. Gotta say, hated it a bit as I had to use premade CSS code which required me to waste time on understanding how to use somebody elses solution instead of learning basic technologies themselves but fine, had to try it sometime.

Next topic - Flask.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1661854433901260800)


### Day 68: May 30th, 2023
Took the weekend off and started learning Flask yesterday and today in CS50x Week 9 lecture.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1663636067046633473)


### Day 69: June 3rd, 2023

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1665102050764500992)


### Day 70: June 12th, 2023
Had a whole week skippage this time due to travel, then weekend comming. Long story short - once you start being comfortable with skipping learning days, it all goes south fast.
Finally back to it, will do my best to skip as little as possible till the end. Completed Flask lecture in CS50x Week 9, next are labs and problem sets.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1668359303667777540)


### Day 71: June 13th, 2023
Completed CS50x Week 9 lab where the task was to render data pulled from the database with Flask and implement basic data manipulation from the web front end.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1668706723798958087)


### Day 72: June 14th, 2023
Started CS50x Week 9 problem set where the task is to complete a web application for trading stocks with Flask. Today I completed the functionality of registering new users.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1669087160220237825)


### Day 73: June 15th, 2023
Continued with CS50x Week 9 problem set's stock trading app where today I implemented quote fetching functionality with Flask.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1669307134075363329)


### Day 74: June 17th, 2023
Took two days off due to scheduled traveling. Today I'm  back to it - continued working on the CS50x Week 9 Flask finance thingy where I implemented a buying functionality and handled the database.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1670179953697079297)

### Day 75: June 19th, 2023
Continued with CS50x Week 9 problem set's stock trading app and did a solid 3 hours of playing with Flask, Jinja, HTML tables and Javascript. Portfolio summary page done. Almost there.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1670917764272324608)


### Day 76: June 21st, 2023
Another session on CS50x Week 9 problem set's stock trading app, today I implemented selling functionality. Tomorrow history page, some cosmetics and I should be done.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1671641050417446912)


### Day 77: June 22nd, 2023
OK done with the CS50x Week 9 problem set's stock trading app, now to iron out irregularities detected by the automated testing on the course platform. I was hoping to submit this today but it looks like it will be another one.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1671995859800653825)


### Day 78: June 23rd, 2023
Completed CS50x Week 9 problem set's stock trading app now fully and submitted it. So most of those errors from yesterday are due to me not reading hints in the documentation and not checking the staff solution upon which the test is obviously made.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1672343688935010304)


### Day 79: June 26th, 2023
Finished the CS50x Week 10 lecture which was, minus the cringey emoji skit, basically a recap and an outro. So will take a day or two to plan out the final project, then use the rest of the days in this round to complete it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1673458772986003456)


### Day 80: June 30th, 2023
Last few days I was learning about OpenAI API as I plan to use it for my CS50x final project. Idea is to, while at it, learn additional and relevant technology. Will take few more days to test it before starting with the project. Not decided if I'll do some useful tooling with it or do a chat bot.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1674887359530246144)


### Day 81: July 2nd, 2023
Did a bit more with OpenAI API and Javascript and did a small project playing with a text and image creation. I'm mostly ready for CS50x final project but not quite sure wheter to build a usefull Chrome extension or a cool chat-like project nobody will need. Probably gonna do both.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1675627055738675201)


### Day 82: July 9th, 2023
Took a break, then continued with the chat app where I'm exploring openai. Plan was to quickly throw a gui then work on the logic but of course last two days was all about the looks. Got that retro cyberpunk in-wall panel terminal vibe I was looking for.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1678141812446318592)



### Day 83: July 17th, 2023
 Had another break due to traveling and vacationing and continued working on my chatbot once I setteled. Worked last few day on the main app login around rendering messages and fetching anwers and today completed the functionality. Counting all of that as one day since I was working here and there whenever I had time and did not really count nor documented it. Next will be persisting the data, will see about implementing database or possibly a Chrome storage.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1680889164194103297)


### Day 84: July 19th, 2023
Tried working on a deck outside on my vacation during a sunny 36c afternoon and barely managed to hold an hour, both me and my laptop. Created firebase database and prepared dependecies on the project side for it, will try it out as a storage so I can persist the chat data.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1681640023777595393)


### Day 85: July 24th, 2023
Ok, last two days was all about integrating Firebase database to my chatbot project. Somehow, I always lose most time on troubleshooting issues with pulled node modules. Completed the integration, will do a Netlify deployment to learn the serverless functions, then see to rewrite the app so it uses browser's local storage.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1683596884273770498)


### Day 86: July 27th, 2023
Worked more with openAI to see about training it with custom data. Conclusion - quality of service will depend on quality of provided data set. Next will be the deployment and hopefully I can bring this detour topic to an end before the round runs out of days :D

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1684663944735068160)


### Day 87: July 30th, 2023
Ok so I rewrote my openai chatbot to use local storage instead of Firebase to persist data and learned to use Netlify serverless functions which are pretty cool and super usefull. Next session will be the deployment and then I can see about the other project.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1685766889492938752)


### Day 88: August 3rd, 2023
Finally! After few days of messing with Netlify serverless functions and geting them to work, I've managed to tie everything and complete the project.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1687213103933743104)


### Day 89: August 7th, 2023
Decided to do one more project with openAI then decide which one to submit as a final project. This time I'll be building a Chrome extension which will integrate openai functionality in the Gmail composition form. So spent a whole evening trying to make the content script work as expected.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1689026669158277120)


### Day 90: August 8th, 2023
After messing with Chrome local storage api and configuring the content script to persist the api key which the user will need to input for himself, started doing the content script related to the gmail funcitonality. Let's say that it's tricky to select the new mail composition form in the Gmail app.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1689026669158277120)


### Day 91: August 11th, 2023
Turns out it's not that obvious and needs a digging on how to select the element of the Gmail compose email form. Got the basics of the extension working - at some point, it will change the content of your email using openAI.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1689764582867312640)


### Day 92: August 15th, 2023
Spent 2 days poking the Gmail compose and reply elements to see what would be best approach to isolate content of the current email without the signature but keep the signature for later recreation. Concluded  I'll enforce highlghiting the text which need OpenAI processing as it's more direct and less prone to errors or cases uncaught by the script logic. Worked out the signature isolation also so will be good to work on the email recreation after the OpenAI processing next.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1691562905110536628)


### Day 93: August 16th, 2023
After almost three hours I finally figured out why my clicked button does not pick up the correct highlighted text - it's the click event which is changing the pointer element thus screwing the selection. Mousedown works. Now I have all components and can proceed tying everything together.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1691944800407150593)


### Day 94: August 17th, 2023
Still left to polish the styles, see where to cement the button, finetune the prompt and write some error handling but generally, my Chrome extension which takes your email and formalizes it using openAI is done.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1692280551086895121)


### Day 95: August 21st, 2023
Took the weekend off, today back to it. Added error handling logic and some styles, polished the popup config window to look nice, still struggling with positioning of the button in my to-be Chrome extension. By the looks of it, I'll probably go by fixing it to the upper right corner as there it has least chance to overlap with user text.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1693730563650130391)


### Day 96: August 22nd, 2023
Fixed some styles and added the view button for the current api key so it's not just showed in the popup window and tweaked the openai prompt a bit and now I'm pretty much done with the project for my to-be Chrome extension which I plan to submit as a final project for the CS50x. There are things to be imporved both visualy, logically and functions wise but for what it is, I'll just leave it as is. Will submit it to the Chrome store just to see how the review procedure will treat gmail injection and storing api keys in local storage.
