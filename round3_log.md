### Day 1: January 11th, 2023
Starting the third round of the challenge and as usual, took the first day to plot my goals, sort the literature and make a learning plan.

I'll start with [Harvard CS50 Youtube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710) and then it will be all about the Linux and relational databases. But first things first - learn and test the Obsidian markdown editor.

### Day 2: January 12th, 2023
Checked the Obsidian today and gotta say it's a fantastic markdown editor so will start my technical notes and docs there. Key will be to use it just for that specific purpose or otherwise it's just another platform for dashboarding your life.

Created cheat-sheets GitHub repo for tech notes and shortcuts. Tomorrow, I start with Harward CS50 Youtube course.

### Day 3: January 13th, 2023
Started with [Harvard CS50 Youtube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710) and the first lecture which covered basics of computing such as numerical systems, mapping standards, algorithms and pseudo code. This will be fun as it's pure theory for 24 hours.

### Day 4: January 14th, 2023
Checked the CS50 course a bit deeper and decided to enroll and do the official one [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/). So, this one will take me more time than planned in this round as I will have projects, different programming languages etc. but looks like a good introduction to computer science and an opportunity for me to play with the C lanugage.

Today I completed the week 0 lecture which was about core concepts and fundamentals of programing languages and a walktrough of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a visual block based programming language for kids and beginners. So first project will bi in Scatch and probably I'll do some version of [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) game.

### Day 5: January 15th, 2023
Today I started with first project in Scatch. I decided to do a simpler version of Space Invaders and I spent 2 hours making small aliens and spaceship sprites and choosing sound effects. This will take longer then I planned :D

### Day 6: January 16th, 2023
Completed my [Space Intruders](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/789060336) game on Scratch. Next topic - C.

### Day 7: January 17th, 2023
Started Week1 lecture of CS50x where the topic will be C. Today was basics of it, compilers, variables, data types, etc.
Configured VS Code and local environment. Wrote fist hello, world.

### Day 8: January 18th, 2023
Moving on with basics of C in CS50x - if statements, conditionals, nesting. Unfortunately, only an hour and a half today for this.

### Day 9: January 19th, 2023
Today was more on data types, formatting, restrictions with numbers and defining functions. Lecture is over, next will be problem sets and challeges.

### Day 10: January 22nd, 2023
Took the weekend off to celebrate my birthday, now back to it. Lab and half of the first problem set is done, will try to finish it completely tomorrow.

### Day 11: January 23rd, 2023
Ok, today was good, managed to clear three out of four problem sets in CS50x week one lecture - Super Mario pyramid print, double pyramid print and the change counter greedy algorithm. 
Tomorrow I'll do the credid card algorithm and then off to week 2.

### Day 12: January 25th, 2023
So, half a session yesterday but almost 2 hours today, so will count all of that as a day. 
Took me more than expected to do the credit card validation with Luhn algorithm in C working for all cases in CS50x but it was very interesting.
