### Day 1: January 11th, 2023
Starting the third round of the challenge and as usual, took the first day to plot my goals, sort the literature and make a learning plan.

I'll start with [Harvard CS50 Youtube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710) and then it will be all about the Linux and relational databases. But first things first - learn and test the Obsidian markdown editor.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1613283170513833985)


### Day 2: January 12th, 2023
Checked the Obsidian today and gotta say it's a fantastic markdown editor so will start my technical notes and docs there. Key will be to use it just for that specific purpose or otherwise it's just another platform for dashboarding your life.

Created cheat-sheets GitHub repo for tech notes and shortcuts. Tomorrow, I start with Harward CS50 Youtube course.

### Day 3: January 13th, 2023
Started with [Harvard CS50 Youtube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710) and the first lecture which covered basics of computing such as numerical systems, mapping standards, algorithms and pseudo code. This will be fun as it's pure theory for 24 hours.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1614000797616078848)

### Day 4: January 14th, 2023
Checked the CS50 course a bit deeper and decided to enroll and do the official one [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/). So, this one will take me more time than planned in this round as I will have projects, different programming languages etc. but looks like a good introduction to computer science and an opportunity for me to play with the C lanugage.

Today I completed the week 0 lecture which was about core concepts and fundamentals of programing languages and a walktrough of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a visual block based programming language for kids and beginners. So first project will bi in Scatch and probably I'll do some version of [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) game.

### Day 5: January 15th, 2023
Today I started with first project in Scatch. I decided to do a simpler version of Space Invaders and I spent 2 hours making small aliens and spaceship sprites and choosing sound effects. This will take longer then I planned :D 


[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1614759462425731074)

### Day 6: January 16th, 2023
Completed my [Space Intruders](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/789060336) game on Scratch. Next topic - C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1615124573397073924)


### Day 7: January 17th, 2023
Started Week1 lecture of CS50x where the topic will be C. Today was basics of it, compilers, variables, data types, etc.
Configured VS Code and local environment. Wrote fist hello, world.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1615462860725051393)


### Day 8: January 18th, 2023
Moving on with basics of C in CS50x - if statements, conditionals, nesting. Unfortunately, only an hour and a half today for this.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1615833258448625689)


### Day 9: January 19th, 2023
Today was more on data types, formatting, restrictions with numbers and defining functions. Lecture is over, next will be problem sets and challeges.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1616195467720921088)


### Day 10: January 22nd, 2023
Took the weekend off to celebrate my birthday, now back to it. Lab and half of the first problem set is done, will try to finish it completely tomorrow.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1617264128258703366)


### Day 11: January 23rd, 2023
Ok, today was good, managed to clear three out of four problem sets in CS50x week one lecture - Super Mario pyramid print, double pyramid print and the change counter greedy algorithm. 
Tomorrow I'll do the credid card algorithm and then off to week 2.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1617652242768883714)


### Day 12: January 25th, 2023
So, half a session yesterday but almost 2 hours today, so will count all of that as a day. 
Took me more than expected to do the credit card validation with Luhn algorithm in C working for all cases in CS50x but it was very interesting.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1618390227021856774)


### Day 13: January 26th, 2023
Refactored last challenge where I moved some functionalities to functions to practice writing them in C, ended up with 20 lines code less. 
Submitted CS50x week one challenges, ready for week 2.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1618710584706625538)


### Day 14: January 28th, 2023
Again, half of a session yesterday, fine session today - counting it as one day. Started week 2 lecture in CS50x with topics of compiling, debugging and arrays in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1619457305082466306)


### Day 15: January 31st, 2023
Skipped few days due to work, back to it. Finished CS50x Week 2 lesson with strings and string libraries in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1620526370458841089)


### Day 16: February 2nd, 2023
Had to skip another day due to home budgeting and finance revision, today back to it. Completed CS50x Week 2 lab where the task was to build a simple Scrabble game in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1621265954045939714)

### Day 17: February 4th, 2023
Today I was solving a "readability" problem in CS50x where I had to implement a scoring of a test based on the [Coleman-Liau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index) calculation in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1622002174128439297)


### Day 18: February 7th, 2023
It took me 2 days to solve the "bulbs" problem in CS50x where the main point was decimal to binary conversion. Two things I learned - working with multidimension arrays and that I forgot basic math :D

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1623091736560934913)


### Day 19: February 8th, 2023
Solved the "Substitution" problem set in CS50x Week 2 section where the task was to accept a specific key and encrypt given string based on it in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1623460995363471361)


### Day 20: February 11th, 2023
Spend 2 sessions on troubleshooting why CS50x is not accepting my solution to the "Caesar" problem. Turns out they were counting on printing letters directly from the loop while I was appending those to a string first and then printing the whole string at once. Since the string was [null terminated](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~davis/cpeg222/AssemblyTutorial/Chapter-20/ass20_2.html), it was a no go.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1624503424883490816)


### Day 21: February 13th, 2023
Completed last problem set in CS50x, Wordle50. Next chapter - algorithms.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1625254037003071504)


### Day 22: February 15th, 2023
Started Week 3 lecture in CS50x about algorithms where the topics were performace, big O\Ω\Θ notations and basic search algorithms. Also learnt how to define strucs in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1625972609178370176)


### Day 23: February 16th, 2023
Finished the Week 3 lecture in CS50x about algorithms where the topics were sorting algorithm, evaluating them and recursion. Gotta invest more time in understanding recursion before I jump to problem sets so tomorrow will be that.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1626343157188157441)


### Day 24: February 19th, 2023
Seems this round will be full of skipped days but it is what it is. Did a solid read/youtube watch on the recursion to understand it betted. It will probably click once I start doing some code with it. Completed Lab3 of CS50x Week 3 where I was benchmarking some sorting algorithms to see which is which.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1627424883880693760)

### Day 25: February 20th, 2023
Continued today with CS50x Week 3 problem sets and solved "Plurality". Took me way more time than needed as I started complicating with auxilery arrays to store results to while solution was rather simple - track the maksimum vote value and then, in another loop, print just those with that same value as a vote value.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1627795522323898368)

### Day 26: February 22nd, 2023
Yesterday and today I worked on a CS50x Week3 problem set called "runoff". Lesson to be learned here is that if you did not understand given data structure completely, you won't be able to write functions which handle/depend on it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1628511571633741824)

### Day 27: February 24th, 2023
Yesterday I worked a bit on the other CS50x Week 3 problem with a [Tideman method of ranked pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs), then today started Week 4 lecture which will be about memory. So half a work there, half a work here, let's call it a one day.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1629247688645521409)


### Day 28: February 27th, 2023
Took the weekend off. Back to it today - continued with CS50x Week 4 lecture where I was learning about pointers, strings and poking around memory in C.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1630320805216124930)


### Day 29: February 28th, 2023
Continued with CS50x Week 4 lecture and more about the memory - malloc, free, garbage values and how string are working in C. There is just 20 minutes of lecture left but calling it a day as concentration is low.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1630687404788006913)


### Day 30: March 3rd, 2023
Yesterday and today I finished the Week 4 lecture and completed both lab assigments. Got sick and the focus was low and hazy but managed to complete the assigments. Next - problem sets.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1631769813243576322)


### Day 31: March 5th, 2023
Skiped a day. Worked on the first problem set called filter where the task was to implement few types of image filtering types (blur, sephia etc.). Spent more time than needed figuring out why my reflection is returing same identical image - turns out if you go row by row, you need to stop swapping first-to-last pixel at the middle, otherwise you get same image :D Tomorrow I do blur, submit, then next one.
