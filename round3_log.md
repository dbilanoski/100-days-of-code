### Day 1: January 11th, 2023
Starting the third round of the challenge and as usual, took the first day to plot my goals, sort the literature and make a learning plan.

I'll start with [Harvard CS50 Youtube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710) and then it will be all about the Linux and relational databases. But first things first - learn and test the Obsidian markdown editor.

### Day 2: January 12th, 2023
Checked the Obsidian today and gotta say it's a fantastic markdown editor so will start my technical notes and docs there. Key will be to use it just for that specific purpose or otherwise it's just another platform for dashboarding your life.

Created cheat-sheets GitHub repo for tech notes and shortcuts. Tomorrow, I start with Harward CS50 Youtube course.

### Day 3: January 13th, 2023
Started with [Harvard CS50 Youtube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710) and the first lecture which covered basics of computing such as numerical systems, mapping standards, algorithms and pseudo code. This will be fun as it's pure theory for 24 hours.
