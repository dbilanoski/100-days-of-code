### Day 1: February 1st, 2024
Starting the fourth round of the challenge and as usual, took the first day to plot my goals and sort the literature but this time I had some unfinished business which I'm gonna do from last round so planning did not took long time.

I'll start with [FreeCodeCamp Relational Databases & Linux Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/), then do some clean up on my Github and Linkedin, and if I have time, will try to squiuze a Google Cloud Associate course I've been wanting to take. Might be too much for one round so in case there is little time left - I'll do some Python automation and leave cloud certification for the winter.

Today I started and completed first chapter of the fcc course - "Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate".

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1753179642268151889)


### Day 2: February 2nd, 2024
Started "Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database" section of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course and got to exactly 50%.

Course interface is a bit janky, let's hope it won't cause issues like not saving progress after few hours ðŸ¤¨

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1753537461454586277)


### Day 3: February 3rd, 2024
Completed the other half of the Mario database section of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course. 

As I was fearing yesterday, progress saving issue came to be. Upon completing and exiting the virtual environment, section was not flag as completed.Luckly, reinitiating it showed the copletion button which then marked the section correctly.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1753908965207920653)


### Day 4: February 4th, 2024
Started working on the first assignment project in the fCC's db course where task is to build database of celestial bodies. Plotted things, wrote out commands for table/column creation, sorted out relations and started inserting data.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1754259843311960298)


### Day 5: February 5th, 2024
Completed the Celestial Bodies database assignment and started next section which will be covering topic of bash scripting.

Celestial Bodies project steps can be glanced [Here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/universe-prep.sql)

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1754628427653509335)


### Day 6: February 7th, 2024
Second day where fCC's rdb course moduls are hanging with issues in staring virtual envoroments. 

Yesterday I was fooling around with some unrelated Python project, today decided to run the course locally while waiting. Spent a solid hour troubleshooting docker containers. Got it to work, will count those two as a day.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1755355269633122755)


### Day 7: February 8th, 2024
Finally course content became available over at CodeAlly virtualization platform so I went over half of the Bash scripting module. Thought about doing it all in one seat but I was just too tired.

Hopefully, it will still be accessible tomorrow.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1755729111912194175)


### Day 8: February 12th, 2024
Now that was a busy weekend. Worked the challenge a bit on Friday and Saturday, took the Sunday off and completed the Bash scripting module of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course today. So.. counting all of that as a one day ðŸ˜Ž 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1757157825233433081)


### Day 9: February 13th, 2024
Started the next module in the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course called "Build a Student Database: Part 1" and got to around 80% of it. Worked for a solid 2 hours and gotta say, bash has some weird syntax but kinda digging it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1757524352382194093)


### Day 10: February 14th, 2024
Today kept in short and Completed "Build a Student Database: Part 1" module. Learned a lot and first time I was working with Gitpod platform.

Tomorrow second part of Studet Database module, then the next certification required project.

Shell script which writes to a database from csv files I was working on during module available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/insert_data.sh).

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1757874845134581780)


### Day 11: February 15th, 2024
Started freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases module called "Build a Student Database: Part 2" and got to 50%. So far it was all about querying data from the database built in the previous lesson.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1758243767012696395)


### Day 12: February 17th, 2024
Skipped a day yesterday, today back to it. Worked on the Student's database part 2 module for around an hour and gotten to 75% of it.

Wanted to complete it today but I was just too tired.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1758981838507278454)


### Day 13: February 18th, 2024
Completed the part 2 of the Students's db project and it was a bit tedious as I was just rushing through all the questions to finish it.

It's just the worst when you force something tired just to complete it. Will remember that and next time just take a day off.


[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1759348529523273913)


### Day 14: February 19th, 2024
Took a short detour from the RDB course and worked on my first Medium article today. While at it, I needed a platform for tracking ideas and working on those so I crafted s simple Notion platform to get me started.

This aligns with my goals and today I had an interesting case on the work so I thought I use the situation fully and make an effort do write it.

It's not completed yet fully but structure, intro and summary is there so we'll see if I can make it tomorrow.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1759709749296161267)


### Day 15: February 20th, 2024
Worked a bit more on my first article and completed a final draft and assets around it. Will leave it for a final review before publishing it next Tuesday.

In the meantime, moving on with the RDB course. Started second certification required project called World Cup. Sorted out the database, leaving the bash scripting for tomorrow. 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1760054181531148621)


### Day 16: February 21st, 2024
Continued wokring on the fCC's RDB course where I completed bash script for inserting csv data to a database. 

As always I drifted away from the main course, this time by tinkering with arrays in bash. Did not need it for the assigment but wanted to see how to work with them. That will cost me another day on this assigment as I did not have time to complete all queries tonight.

It's all good.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1760432914980864371)


### Day 17: February 24th, 2024
Skipped a day or two, now finally back to it. Completed World Cup database project from FreeCodeCamp's RDB course.

Project database dump available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/worldcup/worldcup.sql).
Project database insertion script available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/worldcup/insert_data.sh).
Project queries available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/worldcup/queries.sh).

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1761413074240631149)


### Day 18: February 25th, 2024
Today I worked on my Medium article, drafted it on the platfrom. Need slight adjustment on the images and another set of eyes to read it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1761880716478943255)


### Day 19: February 28th, 2024
Skipped a day, then worked a bit yesterday and a bit today on the "Build a Kitty Ipsum Translator" project from the fCC's RDB course where I got to 50% of completion. 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1762939278152069509)


### Day 20: February 29th, 2024
Completed the Kitty Ipsum Translator project from the fCC's RDB course. Gotta say, I did use `sed` command to replace simple things but had no idea how practical and powerfull it is when you plug in regex patterns and start piping it with grep.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1763323302398021826)


### Day 21: March 4th, 2024
Used a weekend to work on my next article, today was preparing assets and a final draft. Will count all of that as a one day, tomorrow back to the RDB course.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1764797040683368558)


### Day 22: March 6th, 2024
Start working on a next assignment from the fCC's Relational Databases course where I'm building a bike rental shop using Bash and SQL.

I gotten to around 40%, calling it a day.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1765501976035377266)


### Day 23: March 7th, 2024
Continued working on the fCC's Relational Databases course where I'm building a bike rental shop using Bash and SQL and worked over another third of it.

It's just great writing terminal base applications. Reminds be of childhood games and qbasic on old pentium computers.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1765855706371039688)


### Day 24: March 11th, 2024
Took the weekend off, today back to it. Completed the Bike Rental Shop assignement from freeCodeCamp's RDB course and enjoyed the textual/terminal nature of it as it reminded me of childhod.

Next one will be one of the assignements required for the certification.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1767304587659100323)


### Day 25: March 13th, 2024

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1768026474236227995)


### Day 26: March 17th, 2024
Ok, this week I was super busy and just did too little here to count it. So yesterday I continued with the fCC's rdb course project where I sorted the database. Today started working on a bash script for my appointment scheduler.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1769488046594896259)


### Day 27: March 18th, 2024
Completed freeCodeCamp Relational Database's "Build a Salon Appointment Scheduler" project needed for the certification.

As always, time spent on troubleshooting why I'm not passing automated tests was due to me implementing things which are not required :D 

Project database dump available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database-course/salon-appointment-scheduler/salon.sql).

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1769840085170549015)


### Day 28: March 19th, 2024
Completed next chapter of the freeCodeCamp Relational database course where I draw a castle using Nano. Short, sweet and nothing new. So I took the rest of the session to work on the aesthetics of my Github profile.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1770222850177110059)


### Day 29: March 21st, 2024
By the time I could actually sit and study yesterday, I was completely depleted and took a day off. Today back to it.

Started next chapter of the freeCodeCamp's RDB course "Learn Git by Building an SQL Reference Object" and got to around 50% of it. Learning git things I've never used.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1772384141734019276)


### Day 32: March 27th, 2024
Worked a bit on the shell script from the fCC's rdb course "Periodic Table Database" assignment but had to cut it short. Implemented main logic for checking cli arguments, next will be database querying and output.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1773090154229498143)


### Day 33: March 28th, 2024

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1774922822164283637)


### Day 35: April 2nd, 2024
After more than hour of chasing test results and why they were failing in the Gitpod instance of the fCC's RDB course I finally made if out. All of those were formatting issues eventhough I'm pretty sure I was fine on several ocassions but hey, nothing beats the troubleshotting session before bed.

Completed fifth certification project in the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course and with that, I finished the course.

Project database dump available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database-course/number_guessing_game/number_guess.sql).

Project shell script available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database-course/number_guessing_game/number_guess.sh).


[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1775284258300379258)


### Day 36: April 7th, 2024
After completing the freeCodeCamp's Relational Database course, I took a few days to research materials related to the GCP associate engineer cert which I'm gonna study next (for the rest of this round) so counting all of those as a one day. 

Decited to go with the ExamPro's [Google Cloud Associeate Engineer Course published on freeCodeCamp's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpno8FSqpc8). Then will do Google's "learning path" materials and finish off with some prep examps.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1777007451545436182)


### Day 37: April 9th, 2024
Started learning for the GCP associate certification from the ExamPro's [Google Cloud Associeate Engineer Course published on freeCodeCamp's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpno8FSqpc8) and got through the initial prep and cloud fundamentals.

Learned about cloud characteristics, deployment and service models, which was quite useful, especially understanding how the stack elements responsibility changes between different XaaS modes, from completely handled by you, to a ready made software where you handle nothing.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1777795197251776775)


### Day 38: April 29th, 2024
Took a two-week break due to family vacation, traveling, crazy schedule and a needed personal down-time. Last week was researching and this week will be implementation - all about rehauling my CV and public porfolio, a topic now pending for a quite some time, and in a need of immidiate attention.

I did include this in my challenge plan as a goal but not counting last week at all as I want to save some days for the actual learning. So today was updating the design of my CV.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1785060668057542970)


### Day 39: April 30th, 2024
Continuing with my CV\public profile overhaul, today I completed the CV data. Each time I tackle this, I get astounded how incredibly hard it is to condense your knowledge and experience into bullet points, especially keeping it on one page. After some hours of trying to keep it on one page, just went and did in on two pages. Had to rework design a bit but got it looking nice and usable.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1785429115866083457)


### Day 40: May 6th, 2024
Finally done with my CV\public profile overhaul. Well, not completely, still need to revise some GitHub repos and stuff here and there but will not waste any more time in this round on that. So, last few days was mostly rewriting personal data, updating LinkedIn, counting all of it as one day.


[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1787246804347580539)


### Day 41: May 7th, 2024
Back to Google Cloud content and the ExamPro's GCP Associate Engineer course, today was a high level overview of computing, network and database services and a bit about Google global infrastructure.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1787953534421360684)


### Day 42: May 26th, 2024
Had to detour from this as I was going through some job related changes which forced me to shift my focus back to databases and SQL, but research and work related to this I was not sure if I wanted to include to this round of challenge. Needed some off time, both for selfcare and to do some decision making. One thing led to another and now I'm looking at a job offer which I'm gonna accept.

This means Google cloud is on hold - gonna do Microsoft SQL Server and TSQL crash course, then we'll see whether I'll be needing a Python refresher.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1794839982114590924)


### Day 43: May 27th, 2024
Shifting focus of this round to databases and programming. Did a bit of course research and started with Microsoft SQL Server and TSQL foundamentals course from Udemy - installed the server, management studio and ready to hit it.


[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1795206444578435245)


### Day 44: May 30th, 2024
Continued yesterday and today further on the TSQL course but did not post here so let's count it as one day.
Worked with basics of SELECT statement and it's clauses. Syntactical differences are between SQL variants are amusing.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1796292542352515368)


### Day 45: May 31st, 2024
Continued with the TSQL course, today the topic was data types - all seven categories of them. 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1796649571109466558)


### Day 46: June 1st, 2024
Continued with the TSQL course, today was all about tables - creating and managing them.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1796980546444140887)


### Day 47: June 3rd, 2024
Continued yesterday and today further on the TSQL course but did not post yesterday so again, counting it all as a day.
Worked more with tables, joins and learnt about database normalization.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1797720909974737021)


### Day 48: June 5th, 2024
Took a day off yesterday, today back to it. Continued with the TSQL course where I was working with Primary keys, Foreign keys and other constraints learning more about the database relations.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1798447499361018219)


### Day 49: June 8th, 2024
Had a busy few days where I squeezed some learning time here and there, let's say one day for all of it.
Worked further with the TSQL course where I was learning about DML, mostly how insert and update work and how to use them.

### Day 50: June 10th, 2024
It's getting harder and harder to stay disciplined at night, especially when the heatwave hits and you overburden your morning routine with excessive physical activity. So skipping days becomes a frequent thing.

Continued with the TSQL course where I worked with DDL and learnt about views. Did few hours for today's session to compensate the weekend off.

### Day 51: June 11th, 2024
Continued with the TSQL course from Udemy where I worked with more Data Definition Language objects, stored procedures and user defined functions. Since the course did a really poor job of showing them, did a bit of research and wrote few examples to see how they work.

### Day 52: June 12th, 2024
Continued with the TSQL course from Udemy where I worked with set operators, then learnt about indexes. Another topic just briefly covered in the course so I'll have to dive deeper elsewhere.

### Day 53: June 13th, 2024
Onward with the TSQL course from Udemy, today were basics about security and access control and how backup and recovery works in the Microsoft SQL server. Nearly at the end of it.

### Day 54: June 14th, 2024
Took a course practice test, got 83% and passed (70% was needed for passage). Then took it again and got 97% which is better. Will need to work on data relation core concepts such as normalization and relation models and the specifics of the syntax, which will come once I start working with it on a daily basis I guess.

### Day 55: June 16th, 2024
Took the Saturday off, today back to it. Did the bonus lectures of the TSQL course and completed it fully. It was a choppy experience with some backtracking to skipped topics, would not really recommend it. Will do another short one to solidify the knowledge and invest few sessions in relational database core concepts.

### Day 56: June 21st, 2024
Past few days I explored additional SQL\Relational databases materials aiming to solidify a knowledge a bit but did not post here. I enrolled in the LinkedIn learning path called "Master SQL Development" which will get me through few shorter courses on a more advanced topics.
Spent 3 hours importing course data to a database.
