### Day 1: February 1st, 2024
Starting the fourth round of the challenge and as usual, took the first day to plot my goals and sort the literature but this time I had some unfinished business which I'm gonna do from last round so planning did not took long time.

I'll start with [FreeCodeCamp Relational Databases & Linux Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/), then do some clean up on my Github and Linkedin, and if I have time, will try to squiuze a Google Cloud Associate course I've been wanting to take. Might be too much for one round so in case there is little time left - I'll do some Python automation and leave cloud certification for the winter.

Today I started and completed first chapter of the fcc course - "Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate".

### Day 2: February 2nd, 2024
Started "Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database" section of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course and got to exactly 50%.

Course interface is a bit janky, let's hope it won't cause issues like not saving progress after few hours ðŸ¤¨

### Day 3: February 3rd, 2024
Completed the other half of the Mario database section of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course. 

As I was fearing yesterday, progress saving issue came to be. Upon completing and exiting the virtual environment, section was not flag as completed.Luckly, reinitiating it showed the copletion button which then marked the section correctly.

### Day 6: February 7th, 2024
Second day where fCC's rdb course moduls are hanging with issues in staring virtual envoroments. 

Yesterday I was fooling around with some unrelated Python project, today decided to run the course locally while waiting. Spent a solid hour troubleshooting docker containers. Got it to work, will count those two as a day.

### Day 7: February 8th, 2024
Finally course content became available over at CodeAlly virtualization platform so I went over half of the Bash scripting module. Thought about doing it all in one seat but I was just too tired.

Hopefully, it will still be accessible tomorrow.

### Day 8: February 12th, 2024
Now that was a busy weekend. Worked the challenge a bit on Friday and Saturday, took the Sunday off and completed the Bash scripting module of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course today. So.. counting all of that as a one day ðŸ˜Ž
