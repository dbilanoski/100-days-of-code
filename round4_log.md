### Day 1: February 1st, 2024
Starting the fourth round of the challenge and as usual, took the first day to plot my goals and sort the literature but this time I had some unfinished business which I'm gonna do from last round so planning did not took long time.

I'll start with [FreeCodeCamp Relational Databases & Linux Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/), then do some clean up on my Github and Linkedin, and if I have time, will try to squiuze a Google Cloud Associate course I've been wanting to take. Might be too much for one round so in case there is little time left - I'll do some Python automation and leave cloud certification for the winter.

Today I started and completed first chapter of the fcc course - "Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate".

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1753179642268151889)


### Day 2: February 2nd, 2024
Started "Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database" section of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course and got to exactly 50%.

Course interface is a bit janky, let's hope it won't cause issues like not saving progress after few hours ðŸ¤¨

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1753537461454586277)


### Day 3: February 3rd, 2024
Completed the other half of the Mario database section of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course. 

As I was fearing yesterday, progress saving issue came to be. Upon completing and exiting the virtual environment, section was not flag as completed.Luckly, reinitiating it showed the copletion button which then marked the section correctly.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1753908965207920653)


### Day 4: February 4th, 2024
Started working on the first assignment project in the fCC's db course where task is to build database of celestial bodies. Plotted things, wrote out commands for table/column creation, sorted out relations and started inserting data.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1754259843311960298)


### Day 5: February 5th, 2024
Completed the Celestial Bodies database assignment and started next section which will be covering topic of bash scripting.

Celestial Bodies project steps can be glanced [Here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/universe-prep.sql)

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1754628427653509335)


### Day 6: February 7th, 2024
Second day where fCC's rdb course moduls are hanging with issues in staring virtual envoroments. 

Yesterday I was fooling around with some unrelated Python project, today decided to run the course locally while waiting. Spent a solid hour troubleshooting docker containers. Got it to work, will count those two as a day.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1755355269633122755)


### Day 7: February 8th, 2024
Finally course content became available over at CodeAlly virtualization platform so I went over half of the Bash scripting module. Thought about doing it all in one seat but I was just too tired.

Hopefully, it will still be accessible tomorrow.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1755729111912194175)


### Day 8: February 12th, 2024
Now that was a busy weekend. Worked the challenge a bit on Friday and Saturday, took the Sunday off and completed the Bash scripting module of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course today. So.. counting all of that as a one day ðŸ˜Ž 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1757157825233433081)


### Day 9: February 13th, 2024
Started the next module in the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course called "Build a Student Database: Part 1" and got to around 80% of it. Worked for a solid 2 hours and gotta say, bash has some weird syntax but kinda digging it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1757524352382194093)


### Day 10: February 14th, 2024
Today kept in short and Completed "Build a Student Database: Part 1" module. Learned a lot and first time I was working with Gitpod platform.

Tomorrow second part of Studet Database module, then the next certification required project.

Shell script which writes to a database from csv files I was working on during module available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/insert_data.sh).

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1757874845134581780)


### Day 11: February 15th, 2024
Started freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases module called "Build a Student Database: Part 2" and got to 50%. So far it was all about querying data from the database built in the previous lesson.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1758243767012696395)


### Day 12: February 17th, 2024
Skipped a day yesterday, today back to it. Worked on the Student's database part 2 module for around an hour and gotten to 75% of it.

Wanted to complete it today but I was just too tired.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1758981838507278454)


### Day 13: February 18th, 2024
Completed the part 2 of the Students's db project and it was a bit tedious as I was just rushing through all the questions to finish it.

It's just the worst when you force something tired just to complete it. Will remember that and next time just take a day off.


[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1759348529523273913)


### Day 14: February 19th, 2024
Took a short detour from the RDB course and worked on my first Medium article today. While at it, I needed a platform for tracking ideas and working on those so I crafted s simple Notion platform to get me started.

This aligns with my goals and today I had an interesting case on the work so I thought I use the situation fully and make an effort do write it.

It's not completed yet fully but structure, intro and summary is there so we'll see if I can make it tomorrow.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1759709749296161267)


### Day 15: February 20th, 2024
Worked a bit more on my first article and completed a final draft and assets around it. Will leave it for a final review before publishing it next Tuesday.

In the meantime, moving on with the RDB course. Started second certification required project called World Cup. Sorted out the database, leaving the bash scripting for tomorrow. 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1760054181531148621)


### Day 16: February 21st, 2024
Continued wokring on the fCC's RDB course where I completed bash script for inserting csv data to a database. 

As always I drifted away from the main course, this time by tinkering with arrays in bash. Did not need it for the assigment but wanted to see how to work with them. That will cost me another day on this assigment as I did not have time to complete all queries tonight.

It's all good.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1760432914980864371)


### Day 17: February 24th, 2024
Skipped a day or two, now finally back to it. Completed World Cup database project from FreeCodeCamp's RDB course.

Project database dump available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/worldcup/worldcup.sql).
Project database insertion script available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/worldcup/insert_data.sh).
Project queries available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database/worldcup/queries.sh).

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1761413074240631149)


### Day 18: February 25th, 2024
Today I worked on my Medium article, drafted it on the platfrom. Need slight adjustment on the images and another set of eyes to read it.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1761880716478943255)


### Day 19: February 28th, 2024
Skipped a day, then worked a bit yesterday and a bit today on the "Build a Kitty Ipsum Translator" project from the fCC's RDB course where I got to 50% of completion. 

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1762939278152069509)


### Day 20: February 29th, 2024
Completed the Kitty Ipsum Translator project from the fCC's RDB course. Gotta say, I did use `sed` command to replace simple things but had no idea how practical and powerfull it is when you plug in regex patterns and start piping it with grep.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1763323302398021826)


### Day 21: March 4th, 2024
Used a weekend to work on my next article, today was preparing assets and a final draft. Will count all of that as a one day, tomorrow back to the RDB course.

I gotten to around 40%, calling it a day.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1765501976035377266)


### Day 23: March 7th, 2024
Continued working on the fCC's Relational Databases course where I'm building a bike rental shop using Bash and SQL and worked over another third of it.

It's just great writing terminal base applications. Reminds be of childhood games and qbasic on old pentium computers.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1765855706371039688)


### Day 24: March 11th, 2024
Took the weekend off, today back to it. Completed the Bike Rental Shop assignement from freeCodeCamp's RDB course and enjoyed the textual/terminal nature of it as it reminded me of childhod.

Next one will be one of the assignements required for the certification.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1767304587659100323)

### Day 26: March 17th, 2024
Ok, this week I was super busy and just did too little here to count it. So yesterday I continued with the fCC's rdb course project where I sorted the database. Today started working on a bash script for my appointment scheduler.

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1769488046594896259)


### Day 27: March 18th, 2024
Completed freeCodeCamp Relational Database's "Build a Salon Appointment Scheduler" project needed for the certification.

As always, time spent on troubleshooting why I'm not passing automated tests was due to me implementing things which are not required :D 

Project database dump available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database-course/salon-appointment-scheduler/salon.sql).

[Twitter post](https://twitter.com/DBilanoski/status/1774922822164283637)


### Day 35: April 2nd, 2024
After more than hour of chasing test results and why they were failing in the Gitpod instance of the fCC's RDB course I finally made if out. All of those were formatting issues eventhough I'm pretty sure I was fine on several ocassions but hey, nothing beats the troubleshotting session before bed.

Completed fifth certification project in the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course and with that, I finished the course.

Project database dump available [here](https://github.com/dbilanoski/whole-year-of-code/blob/master/exercises/round_4/fcc-relational-database-course/number_guessing_game/number_guess.sql).

### Day 36: April 7th, 2024
After completing the freeCodeCamp's Relational Database course, I took a few days to research materials related to the GCP associate engineer cert which I'm gonna study next (for the rest of this round) so counting all of those as a one day. 

Decited to go with the ExamPro's [Google Cloud Associeate Engineer Course published on freeCodeCamp's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpno8FSqpc8). Then will do Google's "learning path" materials and finish off with some prep examps.
