### Day 1: February 1st, 2024
Starting the fourth round of the challenge and as usual, took the first day to plot my goals and sort the literature but this time I had some unfinished business which I'm gonna do from last round so planning did not took long time.

I'll start with [FreeCodeCamp Relational Databases & Linux Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/), then do some clean up on my Github and Linkedin, and if I have time, will try to squiuze a Google Cloud Associate course I've been wanting to take. Might be too much for one round so in case there is little time left - I'll do some Python automation and leave cloud certification for the winter.

Today I started and completed first chapter of the fcc course - "Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate".

### Day 2: February 2nd, 2024
Started "Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database" section of the freeCodeCamp's Relational Databases course and got to exactly 50%.

Course interface is a bit janky, let's hope it won't cause issues like not saving progress after few hours ðŸ¤¨
